Glas Tulaichean (#82)(M-079)

Date : Mon 30-Aug-2021

 

Left Fife at 8:24am

Arrived Dalmunzie Castle Hotel 10:10am. Time 1:46 Drive.

17 DegC.

 

Met Paul & Calum in Spittal of Glenshee, I phone the castle for a car parking place Â£5

and we headed up.

 

We set off 10:20am.

 

Got to the point when the tractor track was crossing the Shee Water and avoid that

by head up the hill to the disused railway. It was still a bit boggy.

Paul said we maybe should have crossed the Shee Water and use that track.

We did that on the decent.

 

We reached the ruins of the Hunting Lodge in 50 mins.

We need to cross the Alt Ghlinn Thaitneich to get to the track up the Munro.

Paul went 1st and stumbled and fell on the far bank.

He hurt his back which gave him pain for the rest of the day.

 

We passed 4 by 4 car parked by the side of the track.

We heard bangs going off at a far distance, these were grouse shots.

 

Calum was a quick climber being in his 20s.

Paul was fast too , fair bit faster than me.

 

As we gained height we can start to see the hills near by the the Glen Shee Ski Centre hills,

Loch Vrotachan and on the west side the 3 Munros of Beinn A'Ghlo.

 

We passed a pick up truck by the side of the track and see and hear the group of shooters

and dogs in the distance.

 

Reach summit in 2:55

 

We see the slightly lower Munro of rock strun Carn an Righ to the direct west, and the Loch nan Eun

This is the 2nd Munro of the pair. 

 

On the decent we see big bird of prey, circling on thermals maybe a Buzzaed or maybe a Golden Eagle.

 

We cross the Shee Water twice ti get back to car, stop at Hotel for refreshment before heading home.

 

5:30 on hill.
