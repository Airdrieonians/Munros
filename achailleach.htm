A'Chailleach

Sun 31-OCT-2010

Clocks change day.
Picked Andy Phillips up at Jock's Lodge at 9AM BST 8AM GMT from Musselburgh.
Stopped off at Sainsbury's in Kinross for sanies.

Go there in 2:20 from Jock's Lodge. But further tahn I thought.

A little cloudy, 10 degrees, watery sun came out a bit latler in the day

Parked above Newtonmore.

Walked along a trackter track by the burn for 30-40 mins then tried to cropss the burn.
It was not obvious were to cross, we took about 20 mins stoting about 
looking for good steping stones.
I am scared of falling in the water and dont like crossing burns.
Andy got accross first and I gigerly followed him.
I forgot my camera too so will need to get Andys pics to put on web.

We need to climb up to a stakers hut. the map says there is a defined path - mince, 
there is nothing but heather and soggy peat.

We saw 2 folk at the top of the rise looking back down at us.

We got to the rise in about 2 hrs.
Then we could see the summit to our right.
The path on the map went straight to the col and took a right,
there was no path. and we do not go to the col first, 
we just head straight for the summit, through boggy ground.

The last steep climb to the summit was a bit of a tester.

Got to summit in 3HRs exactly.

There was a big cairn and we could see 2 sets of 2 on the next hill.
We would have done it too if there was more light.
We had maybe 3 hrs  of light left and it would take amybe an hr to get to the 
next summit and them getting back might be in darkness in part.

We came down the way we went up in 1Hr 40 mins.

Awflie boggy hill not to fused about going back.
This is the first hill I have climb which has no "M" number.
I.E it was not on Mr Munro's original list.
He made a mistake by making the next hill a Munro when it was in fact 10 meters 
lower than this one.
