stuchd an lochain

Sat 14-AUG-2010

Started early 8:30 drive got their 11:08. from Musselburgh.
Cloudy warmish maybe 18 degrees,

Walked round Loch Na Daimh for 100 yards before path take you on hill.

Then shallow incline for couple hundred yards before stiking straigh a up a really steep grassy slope.

I was trying to go slow to conserve enery.
Steep slopes really exhast me.

Took me 1hr 40 to get to the fence posts and little cairn attop of ridge.
Met 3 folk comming down.
Needed long rest - exhasted.

Tried to walk on without going to top of next hill @ 887 M.
But not possible.
Then on to next top after decending 50m.
Another smaller decent before the summit csn be climebed.
Can see the circular loch at this poit.
It lookes great.
This is a wee gem of a hill.

Met 2 more folks coming down.

Got top 2hr 40mins(book said 2hr)

Great views.

Met young couple back at the loch view.
They took my pic.

Met 2 more at base of loch.

Highland cows were roaming allover the the car park when I got back.
