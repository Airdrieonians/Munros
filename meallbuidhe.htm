Tue 18-SEP-2012

Left Moness Hotel Aberfeldy at 10:15.

Got to Hill @ Glen Lyon 11:00.

Walked up a grassy shoulder.

When we reached the top, it started to get wet underfoot and boggy,
It was drizzling a bit but there were few clouds in the sky and I thought it would go off soon.

Picked our way through the undulating bog.
I was feeling sorry for poor Lesley,on her 1st Munro, what had I got her into.

We tried to climb out of the bog on the higher ground which was more rocky.
But it did not really get any drier.

We stopped at the top rock for a little something to eat.
We had been walking for an hour by now.

We had walked to the East of the small ridge to get away from the westerly 
wind which was fairly strong.

We reached a plateau and there was more Bog ARRRR!!!!

Got to the top of that and met someone coming down.
He was going to do Stuchd an Lochain next before going home.

We could see the start of the ridge walk to the summit now but had a bit more 
bog to go before solid ground.

It was sunny now and the drizzle had stopped.

Just before making the ridge we met 4 older folk coming down who said the views at the top were the best.
Glen Coe/Schiehallion/Rannoch Moor could all be seen clearly.

We made the Summit after 2Hours 23Mins.
Bright sunshine but strong wind.(But nowhere near as strong as Ben Chonzie)

We could see Schiehallion in the east at the end of Loch Rannoch, Ben Lawers 
in the south east, Stuchd an Lochain directly south and the Big Buachaille in Glen Coe just 
past Meall Bhuirdh which I did with Andy last week.

Stayed on top 25 mins.

Descended a bit east of our ascent to avoid Bog. That worked.
Had Hail shower 30 mins before making it to car.
Wet again for 2nd Munro in a row - this is not my thing at all.



4hrs 30 mins on hill

Back to hotel by 4:30PM
