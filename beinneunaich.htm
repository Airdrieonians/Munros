Beinn Eunaich(#78)

Date : Sat 12-June-2021

Left Fife at 9:25am

Arrived  11:45am. Time 2:20 Drive.

I could have parked by the bridge this time as it was now stoud like Oct last year.

But I just arked the same place as before.

I used the bike as before.

This time I planked it between the 2 farmers gates behind a fen clump.

There were no highland coos this time, so no coo should trample my bike.

The 7 minute cylce, 2 of which to the cow gratting, made fell exausted.

I started walking past the sheep this time in place of the coos.

I was worrried about the possiblity of a windy day that would riun my climb.

I reasoned the Westerly/Southwestery forecast would be shelted bt the bmounyains to the west of my route,

I met a girl onher way to finish her walk and she said it was not too windy on top.

Later I met 2 older men commmg down and the said the wind was not bad, but the clouds came down,

but they come and go and they would clear later.

I took several rest on resting stones but the edge of the tracker track.

Pied wagtails keep me company, my favourite bird.

There we others also, Sparrow sized with light grey front and darker beown head and back.

When they fly they have stark white half tail fethers.

very chirpy.

They were flying in front leading me from rock to rock.

I have seen birds do that to lead you way from their nest if they feel it is threatened.

I reach the bridge over the Alt Lairg Ianachain in 1:15 Hours,

Then on to the track end at the Cruachan Power Station tunnel entrance at 1:37 Hours.

Hieght c1300 feet

I then walk up the Lairg Ianachain to the bealach at 2374 feet (728m) in 3 hrs dead.

I was walking from stone to stone and rsting often 20 stides per rest.

I was feeling bad, nausous with exhastuan at times.

Worry I'n not fit enough to do it today, could turn bsck if I dont stsrt to fell better.


I expect to reach my Big stone on the beleach in an hr and a half.

I got there in 1:23 after 3 hours on the road.

I can see Loch Etive now on the north side.

The cloud is half way between me and the summit to the east.

I can see 3 climbers working their way up and dissapearing in the cloud.

I hoped by the time I get there the cloud would lift.

On my way way it did lift, but by the time I got there,

the cloud was back again. I was struggling s bit again and had a wee

lie down against a nice grassy bit.

I knew there was a very stony bit before the summit, I saw that on walkhighlands website guide.

I reached this and thought I can't be far from the summit.

The walker I saw b4 will ahve continued south and east down a very steeep and dangerous decent.

 

I wont be seeing them again today.

 

I am climbing in cloud now but can see 50 yards or so ahead.

 

I keep thinkinggim close to top.

And I suddenly am as the steepness gives way to a gentle slope.

Nice cairn with wind break hidi hole.

3:50 a good tile the othere hill in this twin took me 4:17 last Oct.

 

I have no views as I.m in cloud.

 

So back down again towards home

 

The cloud has gottten lower now.

 

I know I have reached belach as I'm starting to going uphill.

33 mins from Summit.

I fell on the decent to the Beleach, bent one of my new walking polls,

and lost the stopper off the other.

My balance is cac , neededpolls since me and Lesley did the mot north easterly Munro

in Drumochter a few yrs sgo.

 

I head off South now down open steep grassy slop exactly as I did last Oct.

 

In about 30 yard I escape the cloud and I can see down to the foot of the mountain.

Happy days.

 

I meander down the well kent slope avoiding boggy bits as best I can.

Reach track again with 5 hours on the clock. 1:10 from the summit to here.

 

Pick up bike on the way.

Back at car after 5:53 on the hill.
