Ben Ledi (Loch Loch Lubnaig) (#7) 50th tallest Corrbett
[Hill of the gentle slope or God's hill]

Date : Thurs 24-JUL-2025

Left Fife at 09:50am

Arrived Car Park at bridge over river Garbh Uisge, 1km south of end of Loch Lubnaig 11:12:.
(comfort Stops at Callander main car park)

20 DegC. not sunny. Cloud cover.

Very steep path right from the start.

Excellent path through woodland.

I soon get passed by 2 seperate couples and a young woman.

A late teen ager passes my and then sits down and a friendly dog follows him then heads back down hill.

I was beginning to think this was not his dog.
It turned out his Mother (in her late 40s maybe) was climbing with him.

I took 30 mins to cross the tractor track.
Another 30 mins to get out of the wood onto the open hillside.

In front of you now is a massive cliff face.

The path sensibly turns sharp left to avoid the cliff and heads to the very edge of the cliff to
gain the ridge with a shrpe right turn. It toook 2 hrs to get to the turn.

The mother an son pass me now as I am taking frequent stops for rest.

She says she climbed hill in her 20s, but doesn't remember it being this hard.

Her friend told her there a several false summits to aware of, and the proved very true.

Now I can see the opposite side of the mountain and 2 more lochs come into view.
They turned out to be, Loch Venachar and the famous Loch Katrine.
And I reach summit in 3 Hr 05Mins.

There is a Trig point, cairn  and a little away a hristian cross near the top. 

I can see the Corbett Ben Vane to the north, where I might go next outing.

Also I sit at the top ridge of the corrie looking down to Stank Glen.

I start the decent , I soon pass the mother and son.

I want to beat them on the decent as they beat me on the climb.

I flash past them , at the burn on the decnt looking at the cliffs above, I see them in the distance.

I enter the trees and dont see them again until I'm driving home.over the wodden bridge.

I do Decsnt in 1 hr 30 mins. nearly 5 hours on hill

Driving back I feel a bit feint.
I stop at Stirling services for a drink and choc and rest before continuing.
