Beinn Dorain (#72)


Left Fife late at 9:23am.

Arrived Bridge of Orcy Railway car park, about  noon after slow traffic Callander onwards.
Should have been a 2 hr journey.
But it was English bank holiday weekend.
 
Under rail station bridge and straight on the hill and steep from the start.
It was surprisingly hot, perhaps more high humidity rather than temp itself.
 
I was remembering back to climbing the Beinn an Dothidh many, 13? Years ago with Keith Gibb.
It was a marginal day with cloud then and the unpleasant boggy path sticks in my mind.
 
I donâ€™t remember it being so steep all the way.
 
I do remember the very steep last part of the climb to the bealeach At 744m.
 
There was surprisingly a lot of folk on the hill, a fell runner older woman was one who past me, and gave me a freight.
My pulse was 120 most of the way up.
I stopped often to recover from the heat and sweat.
 
Nearing the bealach the sun came out above the summit and I had a few minutes of sunchine, I had to move a little faster to get to the sunshine edge a bit further up the hill than I was.

A number of folks came down past me at this point, I kept well away as this is my 1st COVID-19 Munro.

I was at the steepest point on the climb and a wee reddish brown dog was yapping away on the near vertical slope to my right, it was tearing after a sheep, the other scattered and the sheep was heading round and downhill but the wee blighter was keeping up with it. They both went round the corner of the hill when the yapping stopped, I don't know what happened. The owner and child were on top of a near by rock shouting after it. Irresposible idiots.

I reached the bealach 744m in 2Hours 20 min. the Munro book said the summit should take 2Hours 30mins.
That's more than a bit sporty.

I changed my soaking T-shirt for a nice new one. I felt ok and headed south up the ridge.
Loch Lyon came into view with the other nearby Munros. It looked great.

I met more folks comming down, I was sick meeting comming down by now and hoped I would not meet any more folk.

There wa still 2 or 3 more steepish inclines to go before the false top cairn and the real top.
It did pretend to start raining a wee bit just to give me a encouragement to get a move on.

The last wee bit between the top was very thin and a shear drop as was the southern edge of the summit.
I looked over and was scared.

Reached summit in 3 hours 58 mins with tea to celebrate.

I now had the target as always of getting down in half the time it took to get up.

I got the poles out to help steady my balance and headed off. It soon got warmer as I decended and I could go with just a T-Shirt.

40 mins got me back to the bealeach and 1 hour 15 mins more to the car.
6 hours 22 mins on the hill.
