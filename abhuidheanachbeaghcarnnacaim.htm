A'Bhuidheanach Beagh & Carn na Caim

Fri 14-JUL2017

Left work at 12:05, Andy P came too.

Got to A9 layby near Dalwhinnie turn off 2:05. Set off at 2:15

Walked south along verge of A9 to a metalled junction with large gates.
Thro' walking gate to good rocky tractor track.

Track veered towards the burn of the left for a bit then climbed south up the ridge. 
A few zigzags before a small crescent bus stop which is half way to the Bealach at 
902 metres.

Reached remains of quarry at Bealach in 1hr 45mins (good going).

Decided to head south to the harder of the 2 Munros A達huidheanach Beagh 1.5 miles 
away over a plateau. 
A few undulating ridges then we hit the bog. We tiptoed our way over it but it tired 
me out a bit. Then we had an unwelcome climb to  A達huidheanach Mhor top then on to 
the triangulation point at the summit of  A達huidheanach Beagh in 2 hours 55mins.

There was a strange peeweep noise following us. I did manage to get a pic of the bird.
Not sure which sort.

We knew rain was forecast for 7pm ish so we battered on back to the Bealach in around 
55 mins after having a sandwich break when we passed safely back over the bog.
We decided we were fresh enough to go for the 2nd Munro of the day, Carn na Caim 1.4 miles 
to the north. The terrain was flatter than that to  A達huidheanach Beagh. Half way there 
it started to rain a little. We hoped it would pass but by the time we reached the summit 
it was raining(4hours 37 mins). Quick photos and wet gear turn round and we head back to 
the bealach and down to the car. Before the bealach we met the only soul we had seen all day. 
English sounding guy with no wet gear and only a t-shirt on and ski poles.

We were walking fast now. Andy's GPS was saying 23 mins then 19 mins for the previous 2 miles.

I wanted to do the descent in half the time of the ascent to the bealach. So 53 mins was the 
target. My legs were turning to jelly, we walked on the heather by the stone track for softer 
ground. We scared some fat looking birds on the way, grouse/moorhen maybe?

Texted Lesley near the end to say we were near the car.

Decent took 58 mins, not far off my target. 6 hours 8 mins on the hill.
