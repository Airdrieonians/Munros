Got to Ben Lawer Hotel carpark 11:00. Set off at 11:25.

Walked west down road to Horn carver cottage then up through Farm.
Into the forest fighting past the ferns.

45 mins to get to end of forest and start out on the open hillside.

Followed Ben Lawers burn crossed at the bridge. could not se how to het up the 
otherside so followed burn. went too far and had to climb steeply out of ravine.

Bright sunshine - no wind, mid teens temp.

Easy walk to Dam, met a Marathon runner jogging up, He asked andy about his Edin 
Marathon T-Shirt

Crossed burn at Dam and headed North towards 834m col.
Ended up walking to the west of the col. to cut off a bit of climbing.

Plenty of Snow fields to cross or avoid.
Could just see the Lochan at the base of Ben Lawers.

It was a hard steep climb.

We could see fence posts, so knew we were nearing the top.
Across a few more snow feilds and we were there. 
Summit 3:55 Hrs.

Great view of snow capped mountains all arround. Esp Lawers and An Stuc.
Looked east to Meall Greig which has no snow.

Met 2 young fell runners at the top. they we going on to An Stuc & Lawers, 
We were just going to go back.
