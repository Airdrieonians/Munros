Beinn Achaladair (#73)


Left Fife late at 8:40am.

Arrived at car park at end of Loch Tulla off the A83 Rannoch moor 10:40.
This is the Sepember weekend.

Sunny at times and 11Deg C at start.
There was a wind from the north, which is good cos it will push me up to the bealach.

Sign on road to Achalader Farm, said authorised vehicles only.
That means I can not park and start there as the book suggests.
I'm none too pleased!
This will add a mile to the walking time.

I walk towards the farm and there is a big sign post says "To Hill" pointing south to sart the hill by going accross almost virgin moorland.
This path was pish!
It was muddy and swampy and had a burn rinning throough it.
The last thing you want is wet feet in the 1st 100 yards of your walk!
Thinking later, I wonder of this is a COVID-19 restriction to keep folk away from the farm.

At took 15 mins to reach the original path near the West Highland railway line crossing.
The crossing is a nice wooden bridge with a sign sdaying "No Vehicular Traffic" . If you drove somthing over the bridge you would end up on the rail lines and get squished by the next train.

This path takes you up the west side of Allt Coire Achaladair.
I read several descriptions of this walk and some show using the west side and other the east side of the Allt.
Though in fairness all the descriptions said go east from the farm and do the Munro to the west 1st them come back down to the farm following the Allt north, where as I'm going south down the Allt.

The path was crap! Boggy Muddy, very steep in places kept crossing the Allt.

I was getting tired and lazy, after carefully shoosing my steeps for an hour. I had long lung at a ok looking but of bog and went up to my knee in it and fell down and rolled on my back. I was startled and found as nearby rock to sit on to recover.

Later I had to cross the Allt and it was difficult to get down tp the water and I had to slide down a rock face to get there on my bum. So now I have a wet right leg and a wet bum!

Last time out it took 2:40 to get to bealach. Unbeleivable today it took 3 Hours 15 mins.

At the start I saw 2 folk with there dog ahead of me. I never saw them again.
I never saw anyone else until 3 hours in. I saw a climber on the way up the ridge to my right which leads to Beinn a Dothaidh. 

I now turn north west to climb the ridge, The wind is annoying now, this wind is on the edge of unacceptable. I usually do not come climbing if WMIS says the wing is stonger than 15 mph.

I'm stuggling badly up the climb. I'm feeling a bit exhasted. There are noe a youngish couple at the bealach I'm looking down on, I thoght they might soon pass me but they are slow.

I want a rest out of the wind, so I snuggle up to a big rock, as long as me which I hid behind for a streched out rest.

The coupe still have not caught me and the 2 guy I saw further up the ridge are now far away I start to climb again. 

I start to see Loch Tulla and the peaks and tops of  Beinn a Dothaidh directly to the west and over thwe loch great looking pointy mountains Stob Ghabhar.
I see one of my next hills on my list Beinn Mhanach, a cycle up Glen Auch for that one.
I see Loch Lyon by its foot.

Views are great and only just get better.

I reach the south top at 1002 metres(4 hours 27Mins) just after meeting 2 guy comming down, I moanabout the wins and they say it much worse on top and to keep away from the edge.

I'm still ahead of the couple and I dec end the sout top quick as I can to keep ahead. 
There are load of folk between the south top and the summit. sometime you do wonder where all these folk suddenly appear from.

2 comming down past be and 3 struggling up the last bit of the climb.

I'm going really slow now and need more rests.

I get to the summit after a very rubbish time of 5 hours and 7 mins.
I wonder if I have taken longer ever before?

The 3 I saw earlier are happily continuing along the up and down ridge to the mext Munro Beinn a Chreachain. I had hopes of doing that myself and dropping down into Crannach Wood and walking back to the fram close to the water of Tulla.
But my strenght is destroyed , no way could I make that. 
I take pics quick and leave to allow the coupe and a young guy who is waiting for a summit photo too.

The view across Rannoch Moor are fantastic.

I'm now on a mission to get back in at least half the time of the acent.
So that would be two and half hours.

I get bach to the bealach in 50 mins - good going.
The young guy is too fast for me, I let him pass.
I see him not heading down the coire to the farm but heading up the next Munro.
His 3rd of the day ! Show off bastard. Wish I could do that.

The accent to the bealach on the west side of tha Allt has scarred me for
life, so I'm going down the virgin grass of east side and head for the framers road which runs part way up this side. I find a dropped ski pole.

This works a treat,  I make good time on the grass, no mud or swamps.

I get to the farmers track unscathed, and walk right into the farm and along the road to the car park. No way was I going to retrace my steps on that shit make shift path they have (not) created.

8 hours 11 mins on the hill.
An outragiously long time.
