A'Mharconaich

Sun 16-MAY-2010


Started @ A9 by B&B at bottom of Glen Fhar @ 12:10AM. 2Hrs drive from edinburgh
Broken cloud - some sun - threat of showers - 12 to 15  Degrees

We have to cross the Perth - Inverness rail line.
Hardly any trains go past, less than one an hour , I guess.
I open the gate without looking and turn round to see a train hurtelling towards me about 
30 yrds away. I close the gate in surprise. The train driver sounds his horn. He waves as 
he passes.

Me & Andy P walked up the tractor track at a slow steady pace.
We reached the Col in 1hr 30 mins.
We branched of to the left and climbed the sholder of A'Mharconaich directly.
I had seen the view over Loch Etricht when I had climbed Geal Charn last year.
Ben Alder looked great with its snow topped peaks.

This time I took notice of Beinn Udlamain, which I had a wee idea we could do after this one.
But in fairness it looked a pretty steep ridge to climb.
It can be seen directly south from the col.

We stopped for lunchen only a little up the hill side.
Andy had hot coffee - good stuff.

We had seen a few group of folk ahead of us as we walke up to the col.
A group of 3 were walking on towards Udlamain as we were going up A'Mharconaich.

But we met 2 folk comming down towards us. I asked them there plans. They had done the 
3 munros in the group already today and were heading to Geal Charn to make it 4.
Dont you just hate these people?  :-)

We made the ridge and could see we had a flat walk to the summit.
I could not see the Glen the other side, Glen Dhomhain, where the other 2 Munros in this 
group were. We walk over to the edge to have a look. Sgairneach Mhor has a big Corrie in front of it.
It was edged with snow and look impressive, I have nice pics of it.

Easy walk to Summit from there. 2hrs 50 mins (although that did include abit of stoating about.)

Comming down the steep slope towards the east, you could see A'Mharconaich has a cracking almost 
cliff like eastern aspect. snow just sdded to the scene. I have good pics. 

You could see directly south that there was a Munro on the skyline much higher than the rest.
We speculated about what one it was. After getting the Map out later - it turned out to be Ben Lawers.
The 10 highest point in Scotland.

Back at car @ 4:50PM after 4hrs 40mins on the hill.
A short one really.
