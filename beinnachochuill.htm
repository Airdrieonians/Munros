Beinn A'Chochuill (#74)


Left Fife late at 8:21am.

Arrived at bridge over Allt Mhoille on B8077 just past Dalmally at 10:30.
There are parking spaces by the bridge.
The place was stouid.

I drove a half mile further and parked in a wooded clearing.
I was expecting parking to be a nightmare but not so many cars.
I had my bike in the back of the car,  incase I had to start miles form the bridge.

Also the 1st Mile or so is flatish and there is a supper farm tracter track.
I was foolishly hoping to cycle to 400m on this great track.
It was far too steep to cycle it. Even in the bottom of my 18 gears, it was exhausting.
I gave it a go foe half amile and gave up and chained the bike to some small shrub trees by the track.

There were highland cow bulls by the side of the track they look great.
Glenn Mhoille is a smashin wee glen.

I saw a guy with dogs cayching me up. I had a wee chat to him , 
he was meeting his pals who were camped at the end ot the walk a mile 
or so up the gradiated track.

I make good progress on the track but it is steep.

I decend and cross the bridge over the Allt Lairig Ianachain and 
after a short acent reach the right turn (Clyde?) and 
after a short climb reach the cairn which is the signal its time to climb 
on to the open hillside.
I see the dog group 200metres ahead up the slope.

It is very steep, my heart rate rises quickly and 
I need lots of stops on some great well positioned rocks.

I am going really slowly. I see a guy walking back down the track.
I wonder where he came from?
I suspect he has come down the Allt Lairig Ianachain.

A young guy and partner suddenly appear 100 yards below me.
Funny how folk can appear out of nowhere on a hill walk.

I let them pass.

I get great views of Stob Daimh which I climed 13(!, how many?) years ago. 

I can see the Lairig Noe, a pass between Glen Mhoille and Glen Noe.
I look it up it is 1800 feet, I am much higher than that.

I can see to my right (East) goups of folk already on the climb from 
the 728m Belach Lairig Ianechain to Beinn Eunaich. 
I had hoped to do that one today too, but I am too exhaused doing this one to add another.

I see a loch high up to the south past the north end of Lach Awe. I wish I knew how high that was, as I am higher than that.


I am near the ridge top now and see the young couple heading from Beinn A'Chochuill doen the ridge heading to Beinn Eunaich. I hid as I'm a bit ashamed of being so much slower than them.

I get great views of Glen Kingglas and I can see as far as Stob Ghabhar/Sob a'Choire Odhair a hill which I intend to do soon.
I can see Loch Etive for the 1st time.


I watched a cloud ploum over Ben Cruchan & Stob Daimh which I was hopping 
was heading south. But the wind was more west and it was heading my way.

I see cross the dog group and say to them I hope that cloud is not going to 
spoil my view to Mull and the sea.
Well it did!

I reach the East top and soon after reach the summit 4hours 17 mins. Far too slow!
The cloud is here, stopping me viewing the west. But thankfukky I still get a 
great view eastwards.

I take pics on top and wait for the cloud to clear for 30 mins. It doesn't.

An apperishon appears from the south. An old woman 65 or 70 years old with 
walking poles. She tells me she has done Ben Cruchan, Stob Daimh already and had cross the Lairig Noe to get here. RESPECT! What a hard route to do when she is so old. She will finish by doing Beinn Eunaich and walk back to her starting point. She is Welsh but sounds Scandinavian.

I give up waiting for the cloud to clear and head east. I'm not going back the horrid way I came, I am going to go the the 728 Bealach and head south down the Allt Mhoille.
I know there is the Track end three quarters the way down. I hope it is not too boggy snf not too steep. I have my poles to the ready. 

2 20 something girls pass me heading for the summit I have left. 
I think these are the folk the couple told me about who have done 
this circit in reverse. 
They started by climbing the maddly steep shoulder of Beinn Eunaich and now they are here. 
Well done to them. 

It takes me 45 mins to reach the 728m beleach (5 hours on the hill)and I go off pist and head down the 
Allt Lairig Ianachain. This idea work out well. I reach the track end in 45 Mins.
I will climb this way the next time I come to do the Beinn Eunaich. This will save any usless climbing, that I would otherwise have to give away.

I motor down the track, now in great walking terrain. I see the dog group strugging down the almost shear final decent to their tent. I speed on, reteive my bike and 
get back to the car 6 hours 36 mins(excluding my 30 mins wait on top) on the hill.
