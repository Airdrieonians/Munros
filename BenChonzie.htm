Drove for 1:45Hr past Dunblane and Braco to Comrie. 
<br>Started walking at 2:38PM. from a car park next to a farm.<br>
Long dirt track, it was windy at the bottom but as we got higher it was getting severly windy.
<br>It was sunny but not warm at about 7 Degrees.
<br>Crossed a burn at a small dam. A hailstorm passed by, we saw it comming and ith the wind
<br>it was pretty annoying. It only lasted a short time. We were climbing into a more sheltered
<br>glen and felt better when we got there. But we knew when we read the top of the glen when the <br>track ran out we would be turning left into a gayle. Just as we reached the end of the path
<br>we saw a walker coming down. We asked him how long to the top and shouting through the gayle
<br>he said about an hour, which turned out to be about right. We reached the top of the next <br>ridge
<br>and the wind really got serious. Every step was a fight against the wind. It was our luck <br>todays
<br>wind was from the north dead against us. There is a fence that runs straight to the summit and
<br>a series of cairns have been built to lead the way too. I had my gloves on but Jim's hands were<br>
<br> freezing. He found an old pair of socks in his pack and wore them. There was a little snow
<br>in patches near the top. We sculked from on cairn to the next sheltering from the wind at each
<br>for a bit of a rest. The hail in the wind stung our faces and we tried to walk backwards at 
<br>times. I was glad I wore my contact lenes as my glasses would have been blown away.
<br>
<br>We peak over the top of a cairn and saw a big round circle of stone and guessed this was the summit.
<br><br>
Time to top 2 Hours 45 Mins.(Book time 2:40)
<br>
<br>
Cloud was comming and going on the top. Could see Loch Turret and a town in the distance Crieff?
<br>
<br>On the way down it was easier with the wind at our backs. Reached the Glen again and loved <br>the 
shelter.
<br><br>
<br>We could see far to the south to snow capped Munros. I guess there were the Lochearn Ben <br>Vorlick and Stur a Chroin.
<br><br>
<br>The sun was out again as we got back to the car, time taken 4:32Hrs.
