Ben Cleuch (Ochil Hills)

Date : Fri 02-Aug-2024


I failed to reach Ben Cleuch summit last time out , 2 weeks ago.
Draged myself to the Law from Tillycoutry.
Took 4 days of fatigue to recover, I blame that on the Covid I had the previous week.

Arrived Car Park Alva Glen 10:20

18 DegC. broken cloud with sun comming through. rain forcast by 2pm.

walk through glen a bit to find path East on to the hill. 
Saw waterfall.

Path takes you to a tracter track, zig zag ing up the hill.

Then a straight section to a sheep pen. Time taken 1 hour.

Then North East up a grassy steep slop.

At the top of the slop you get the 1st sight of Ben Cleuch.

Ben Ever is on the left.
I avoid it by taking flat track to its east. 
Reached Bealach at 1914 ft 582M. 2 hours

Then v steep east to summit, 2:30.

I saw a Red Kite on the way down. 

Decent 1:10.

On the hill, 3:40.
