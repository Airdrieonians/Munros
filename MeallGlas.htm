Drove for 1:45Hr to A85 opposite Ben More. 
<br>Started walking at 11AM. from Auchean Farm<br>
No real track, just heather and grass, it sunny but not warm, not too windy
<br>
<br>Fairley hard going for me. Some snow near the top.
<br>followed one man and his dog up most of the hill.
<br> Got there in 3:40, book time 2:40
<br>Walked along the ridge and dropped in to the glen next to Sgial Chuil.
<br>Pretend skiied down the snow fileds.
<br>Tried climing the 1000ft up to Sgail Chuil, but too tired to do it.
<br>Andy did not even want to try.
<br>
<br>Got back to car after 7hrs on hills
