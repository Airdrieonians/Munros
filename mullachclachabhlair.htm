Beinn Mhanach (M211)(#80)

Date : Sat 31-July-2021

Left Fife at 8:23am

Arrived Top of road to Auch Farm, off A82, 10:45am. Time 2:22 Drive(With Stops)

High teens DegC.

I bike it up Auch Glen, crossing the Allt Kinglass several times via stepping stones.

5 miles of it!

 

It seemed to me the track was down hill as the bike was often freewheeling,

while the river went the opposite direction.

I met a order couple 60s, guy said it was all clear on top.

I said I wanted to be 1st on top today, but they were.

 

Reached the conflence of the Alt a Churin in 1:40 and parked bike behind a big Rock,

Then straight on to the hill, which is immediatly very steep and does not deviate

from this condition until the very top.

 

I stuggle from rock to rock 20 paces is all I can mange with a rest.

 

I can see some great Munros from here.

Creag Mhor being the most impressive,Beinn Heasgarnich & Ben Challum in the S far distance.

(all 3 I've not done yet)

Looking straight down the Auch Glen, there is far off Ben Lui with cloud brushing its summit.

Beinn Dorain and Beinn Dothaidh on my diect right side.

 
The hill directly in front of me is 2,642 ft. I keep wondering if I am above it yet?

Also I can see the Beinn Dorain bealach at 2,439 ft.

 
I estimate 2hrs of ascent at 1,000 ft per hour, it runs out my pace is more like 1:30 for

each 1,000ft.

Reach summit in 5:01 Hrs.

 
I'm annoyed to find someone already on top.

He has done 4 of the Bridge of Orchy hills allready today and is finishing off with

Beinn Dorain next.

He is in his 20s and is a running club member.

 
On they way down I head for the Alt a Churin to re-fill my water bottles, but it is a

mere trickle.

Rainfall has been so light this summer. Near drought conditions.

I get back to the bike at 1:37 decent compared with 3:10 ascent.

 
No I get to ride downhill all the way to the car recrossing the Alt Kinglass on the way.

I fall off once , with only minor scrapes, in 0:46 Mins back at car 7:31 on the hill.
