Geal Charn (Loch Ericht)

Fri 07-AUG-2009


Started walk in car park off A9,Balsporren cottages (B&B) a few miles south of Dalwinnie @ 12:20PM
2:20 drive from Eburgh, big road works though, cost me ~20 mins

Sunny - some cloud -  20 Degrees

Cross the railway, follow good tracter track, til we cros a few burns,
then track splits to go right.
Quite steep - peat boggy a bit.
Midges are out - but not too bad.

Reach a fence stake in ground as marker.

Book says 1:40 to top.

I see someone on track through glen.
Perhaps I will meet them at the bealach.

I look north to see top of Creagan Mor which is 772 M - 2500ft
If I can see the top of it - I must be higher.

Looking to see Loch Ericht, but hills are still hiding it.

Steepness gets less severe, then I reach tall slate cairn. 1:30 hrs
I think I am on top for a second, then look to the north and see a higher cairn.

Flat walk for a fair way to reach summit rise, then get to Summit proper. 2hr on the dot.
My 50th Munro!!!

I fell fairly tired, wonder if I can manage A'Mharconaich(the horseman).

There is a gret view of Loch Ericht and Ben Alder on the opposite side of it.
Loch Ericht is seriously long.

The other side of the A9 I see A'Bhuidheach Beag. Massive plateau.

A'Mharconaich looks great - more interesting than this Munro.
I lie in the windbreak shelter (tho there is no wind), to relax and rest to see if I have the 
energy to do A'Mharconaich.
I see the bealach is at 728M - 2380ft before rising to summit of 975M - 3200ft.
Can I handle a near 1000ft climb?

I wander down to tha Bealach to see how I feel. It takes 25 mins!.
Book says summit to summit is 1hr - no way I can do it that quickly.

I talk myself into giving it a try.
I start to climb A'Mharconaich.
I dont get far before I have second thoughts.

I see a guy comming up the track to the bealach.
He has a yellow stripy rugby top on - no rucksack.

I head for the track to go back to car.
He is staying at B&B and came up for a wander.
English guy about 20 years young.

He wants to know where the track leads.
I tell him is stops just over the bealach & about my walk.

It has taken him ~ 1hr to walk from the B&B to the bealach.
I am thinking if I come back to do A'Mharconaich, I will use the track.

I am dissaponted about not having the fitness to do A'Mharconaich.
I could have done it but I would have been exhausted at the end and in discomfort.

walking down the track is a breeze.
Back at car after 4hr 20mins on the hill - short day really.

Went to House of Bruar tea room on way back - got Mushroom soup & 2 big bits of soda bread.
Great stuff. £5 tho' but I wasn't caring.
