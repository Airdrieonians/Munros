Carn Mor Dearg(#79)
Date : Sat 26-June-2021

Left Fife at 8:40am
Arrived  11:30am. Time 2:50 Drive(Included comfort dtop at nevis range gondola).
North Face car park was overflowing.

I parked a fair bit down the access road and cycled up to start of climb 
and chained the bike to a wire fence.

Great walking weather, a bit of cloud, but too warm maybe, very little wind.

Maps want too clear on how to get through the wood to get acccess to the hill.
It ook me an hour to reach the style over the fence by the dam.
On the way home I found the garden table where I met the group of young English lads 
there is a good path all the way down to the car pk. The lads lsot their way to
 Nevis and were giving up to head home.
I headed of the good path at a single bench seat and followed the Allt a' Mhuilinn,
 I came to the good path again when the lads were eating snackes.
The goodpath would have saved me time and effort. So much for guide books.
The Scottish Mountaineering Club(SMC) famously told you to climb to the half way Lochan 
on Nevis and cut accross to climb CMD, I did this on a trip with the boy Wilson and 
turned back, He continued and did the Arete and Necis while I waited in the car. 
What a dick user he is!.
SMC are dicks too.
WalkHighlands give the best Munro info.

I saw cars parked at the style to get on the hill. If I parked there I would have 
saved myself a 1 hour walk. (Don't know how to drive there thoughP

I took to the open hillside and can immediatly see Nevis cliffs.
I look for the path branching to the right to go up the CMD Munros.
The path itself continues to a club hut up the top end of the corrie.
WalkHighland report said.
It does start getting steeper and less boggy.

There doesnt seem to be anyone on the hill at the same time as me.

I feel a bit nauseous and wished I had brought some paracetemole with me.

I struggle on 20 steps then a sitdown on a rock to recover. its gets steep quik
I might turn back if my sore stomach doesnt improve.
I wonder if it is due to me only having one contact lens in.
I had to chuck one out to see my munbered padlock.

I find another contact lens in my pocket and it made me feel better.
I saw 2 cycleist going up the glen floor towards the Hut. There were shoutinga t each other.

I could see the snow at the top of the Nevis NorthFace cliffs.
There was cloud comming abd going to spoilt the view.

I pressed on, A English guy came down on his own seemingly from nowhere.
I asked about the cloud on top he was higher than the cloud he said and had good views.
Cloud may get higher by the time I get up there.

Saw anothe guy after that with a water bottle uin his hand wereing a Blazert hing and no
rucksack. I tought he was a dick for doing the hill with no gear.
he never came down the path, he just jumped arroung randomly and never came near me.

I was getting higher now and I could see the half way Lochan on Nevis.
I thought this was at about 2000 feet and so I was happy to be half as high as my CMD summit.
Its actually at 1836Feet. I was walking for 3 hours by this point.
I can see Loch Linnhe meet LochEil. Also Loch Lochy up the Great Glen, Beautiful views.

Progress was slow, Day was sweaty, and I was resting on rocks every 20 steps or so.

I make it to a fair sized burn I had to cross, It wsnt on the map.

I see 2 folk a couple coming down the burn side towards me.
They got lost on the decent and couldnt find the path,
When they saw me they head straight for me to get back on the path.

The path is crap.
I can see how it is difficlt to find the path on the boulder stroun summit and ridge.
I can see why this Munro has no ridge walk, the path skirts below the ridge for its entire length,
Cos the walk is very diffict on the ridge with boulder fields everywhere,
also the reason this hill was given the Gaelic name Red is because the earth is red, 
the stones are all red tinged, the Ancients knew what they were talking about when they named this Mountain.

I met the most sensible climber at this point. He had walked up the Glen to the Hut and climbed the Nevis
North Face before traversing ther Arete and CMD summit before meeting me.
The North Face looks scary, how did he ever get up that sheer face of cliffs,
He said its not that difficut(for him?) there is some scree but its not a problem.
Respect to him.
He said he was 20mins on his decent.
I thought I may be 40 mins from the summit.

The path soon turned dirctly up hill heading staright for Carn Dearg Meadhonach, 
the impresive Noth Top. I get there in 5:12.
There is a stone shelter here and You can see snow on the North Facing shear cliffs.

I rest in the stone shelter and take some photos.

I see the summit to the south a half Km away.
I head along over boulders, very uncomfotable walking.

I hear a noise behind and exclaim, "I near shat myself" as a young, 
possibly teenager, runner passes me with a tiny back sack, swimming bag?,  
with a few things in.
I would quite happy through him over the cliff. Youthfull Energy envy.

I get to the summit 5:44.

Great viws of the Arete and I can see lots of folk at Nevis summit.
Cloud over Aonoch Mor and Beag stop me geting a pic. Gor one later when it cleared on my desent.

I see the near shear cliff bealach that seperates them and think , no way could I ascend that.

I speed down not following my ascent, I desend straight down to lose height quickly and try to
 find the path lower down to avoid the crap steep shale like path.
After a bit of shenanagins I rejoin the path and carfully head down.
When I get to the burn I see someone cumming up at this lat hour.

He says he will tent at the summit and the do the Arete in the clear sunny morning.
Good effort.

I decent past the half way lochan on Nevis and calculate I must be 1:30 from the car,
 if I descend twice as fast as I climb. I beat this time by 20mins.

I use the main path from the lads garden table and bench, if goes straigh to the car park 
without all the farting arroung I had to do on the asent.

Back at car after collecting bike, 8:30 on the hill.
