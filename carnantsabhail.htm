Carn an t-Sabhail & Sgor an Lochain Uaine (#83 & #84)(M-004/5)

{English corruption : Cairn Toul}

[Hill of the Barn & Hill of the little green loch]

Date : Tue 07-Sep-2021

 

Left Fife at 06:09am

Arrived Auchlean car park Glen Feshie 08:20am. Time 2:11 Drive.

18 DegC.

 

Set off 08:29am, by bike for 1st km.

 

A few months ago (Fri 23July21) I did a training run up here and reached the

Carn Ban Mor cairn in a very dissapointing 4HRS.

It was very warm in full sun.

The previous Nov (2020) I did it in a very respetable 2:45.

 

I reached the crossing of the Alt nam Meann in 25 min v 1Hr from my last attempt.

I reached the shelter cairn in 1:30 min v 2:30Hr from my last attempt.

I reached the Carn Ban Mor cairn in 2:15 min v 4Hr from my last attempt.

 

I can't explain why these times are so different.

There was no direct sunshine and the temp was less as I started so early in the day.

 

I did not stop and raced to the Cnapan Loch in 3:03.

Well ahead of my shecduke of 5Hr.

My Schedule gave me 2 Hours to cimb from the Cnapan Loach to Carn an t-Sabhail summit.

It took 3:45.

 

Fron Cnapan Loch I headed in only a slight inclined ascent towards the SW shoulder ridge of

Sgor an Lachain Uaine.

It was a bit bogy.

I found a long boulderfield which took me a fair disatnce with no wet ground.

I called this the yellow brick road, though it was more like a grey boulder road.

 

I was now close enough to head staight for the SW sholder ridge of

Sgor an Lachain Uaine. This ridge is a massive boulderfield too, with only small

areas of grass. It was very steep and it took a lot out of me to reach the spine.

5:33 Hrs

 

I can see over to the peak of Carn an t-Sabhail now, it was coming in and out of view

due to the passing clouds.

 

I head for the Bealach at 3,738ft (1140M) which seperated the 2 Munros 6:00 Hs.

I want to climb  Carn an t-Sabhail 1st as it is the highest and hardest.

Great views here of Ben MacDui and Braigh Riabhach {English Corruption:Braeriach}.

I climbed Braigh Riabhach{Braeriach} in July 2000 & Ben MacDui in June 1998.

 

Nearing the summit I get more and more tired. There is no real path, just ways

to navigate round and over massive boulders.

I dump my rucksack and do the rest with cameras water and my

Airdrie 1991 Cup final and European Shirt for summit pic.

 

Get to Summit 6:50 Hrs on the hill.

It is in cloud , bad luck.

 

I rush down to my rucksack and find my Airdrieonians shirt is missing.

 

I'm worried I won't have energy to do Sgor an Lachain Uaine, the thought of missing out would be sad.

I can't waste the energy going back up towards the summit looking for it , so I leave it and go on.

 

Back at the bealeach I force myself to stuggle slowly up the 387 feet to the summit.

Again in cloud, 7:46 Hrs on hill.

 

I start the descent west to the next bealach at 3,688ft (1125m).

I now plan to keep high to avoid all the bogs I had to pass on the way up.

I keep to the West of Clais Luineag burn, This works a treat.

But in the end I must descend to the bog to pass Cnapan Loch.

There are a couple in a tent near the loch.

 

I am exhausted now and all progress is slow.

I reach the crossing of Alt Sgairnich in 10:05 and take on water and rest for 10 mins.

The small incline up the tractor track is painful and it seems to take an age to

get to the grass track back towards Carn Ban Mor, which I reach in 11:05.

I turn on my mobile and text Lesley, that I'm 1:45 from the car.

The sun is now setting and a whiff of cloud passes in front of it giving a great weird

light show for me.

 

The next day was to be sunnier than today, so It makes for a fine cloud free night.

So the gloamin lasted longer than usual and I needed it to get back in the day light

so I can see my foot fall.

I raced down at max speed , in the Forest part at the bottom the light had all but gone.

 

I stepped to the left of the path which was on the edge of a bank, I near fell down the bank.

I used my pole to steady myself and managed to stay on the path.

I broke my Tiso pole, a price worth paying.

 

The stars and planets were all around me, with the lack of light pollution and I saw a

shooting star for the 1st time in  my life.

 

Used moby torch to see bike lock combination and cycled back to car.

12:34 on the Hill,

 

My longest day in the hills ever.
