Carn Liath (Loch Laggan) (#85)(M-127)
[Rocky Grey Hill]

Date : Fri 15-Oct-2021

Left Fife at 08:34am

Arrived Creag Meagaidh Nature Reserve car park 10:40:  2:06 Drive.
10 DegC. It will be zero at the summit

Itâ€™s been 5 or 6 week since my last outing so I may have lost a lot of my fitness

Used bike for 1st km. Up to the Nature Reserve visitor centre and on ward on a good path, that got steeper, I fell of when I went of track a bit which was raised.

I reached a seated area before some steps and I chained the bike there.

The effort of cycling up hill took a bit out of my energy and left me feeing a bit exhausted and wee bit nauseous.

I continues along a good path towards the coire looking for the cairn to tell me to head off up the hillside.

The cairn was tinny

I used my new OS Locater app to tell me in grid co-ords where I was, it worked a treat.

The path was steep straight away and then quickly entered some dense birch woods.

The path got wetter until the only way through the dense wood ws to climb up the running burn from rock to rock. Crazy!

I was looking left and right to see if there was an alternate path.

Glad to get out of the Birch wood, Then the ground got very boggy.

Slow progress and tiring to pick your steps through the bog and find rocks to rest on.

 

I could see the Na Cnapanan top where I would reach the ridge and the walk would be simpler and hopefully less boggy

I go there in a time of 2:00. I did meet 2 guys coming down with nothing but a water bottle as luggage.

 

I could fell a bit of exhaustion and nausea and considered heading back home.

Great views of the winter climbers Mecca of the cliffs of Creag Meagaidh we had and the prominent notch

called the window marking the boundary between those two Munros.

The lochan at the base of the cliffs set the scene off perfectly.

 

I looked at the OS Locator App and I was at near 2,000 ft.

1,300ft to go.

I didn't like the idea of coming this far and gaining this height to go home with nothing to show for it.

 

I decided to go on and get to Corbett height of 2,500ft.

The sun was coming and going.

I struggled on, and a older couple passed coming down.

 

I found a dry patch of path and had a wee lie down with the sun in my face, for a nice rest.

 

The path got rockier now that god.

 

I saw a retired gent coming down with his dog, he steered away from me so we did not pass.

 

I could see from the map the top was on a plateau and a sharp right turn was need then.

 

I find the steepness of the path lessening and a tiny cairn. I wishfully wonder if that is the top.

I get there and see a large boulder 100 yrd ahead and wonder if that is the top.

I get there and see a clump of rocks in the near distance and wonder if that is the top.

I get there and see a bloody big Cairn a 100 yrds away that must be the TOP!

 

As sometimes happens a ghostly figure appears out of nowhere, It was a retired guy doing the ridge from Creag Meagaidh,

One these guys with the goat gene.

 

He get to the cairn 1st, and asks me about the path , I came up cos he was going down that way.

 

Reach summit 3:50, the boom said 2Hr, very slow, 5 weeks without a Munro has cost me my hard won fitness.

I take pic quickly, in the cold and head back , with nausea still lingering.

 

I try to race the guy back down bit in 10 mins he is so far ahead, he is a spec on the hillside.

 

I get though the Birch Burn path very quickly and collect the bike and get back in time to see him,

Get his boot off by his car.

 

5:31 on the hill.
