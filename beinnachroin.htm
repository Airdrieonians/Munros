<br>
<br>
<br>
The weather was dodgy but I took the risk to go.
 <br>
It said it would get sunny after overnight rain.<br>
I reached the kingshouse near Balquider at 11AM, journey time = 1.5 hours<br> 
It was raining I had a baked potato in the Rob Roy bar.
<br>
<br>
A guy came in with an American tourist talking about stag hunting.
<br>
<br>The bar man knew him and they chatted about upcoming social event.
<br>
<br>The barman gave him a case.
<br>
<br>He opened it and brung out the bagpipes and ask if I mind if He play.
I said go ahead. He played for 5-10 mins it was good.
<br>
I drove to inverlochrig past Balquider in light rain. When I reach the car park, one I thought I 
<br>would never need to use again, the rain had pretty much stopped.
I started walking at 12:30.
<br>
<br>The Beinn a Chroin should really be done as the 2nd of two hills paired with A'Castieil But I was too nacked to do it when I did the other.
<br>
<br>There is a car track all the way down the glen almost as far a Beinn Chabhair. I had ideas of Doing Chabhair as an unusual 2nd hill to the main one, but only if I have time and was no too 
<br>tired.

It took 45min to reach the bridge over the ishag burn.
<br>
<br>
I walk another 100 yards and started climbing.
<br>
<br>
The grass was wet. I had assumed that and I wore my shorts so my trouser would not get wet and heavy.
<br>
<br>
It was hard going the ground was very wet and my socks and boots were soaking in no time. It was boggy and tiring. It was difficult to take rests with the ground wet I sat on some rocks but they were wet too.
<br>
<br>
I headed for the left edge of the array of cliffs and rock ahead. 
It was a struggle. I got there but it took a long while.
<br>
<br>
After getting round the top of the cliff I could see another much more steep set a fair way infront. I was considering packing it in. It was rain in spray. and I was a bit wet, my feet especially.
<br>
<br>
I had an idea of trying to climb round the left of these cliffs too but the detour was too great so I just went right up them.
I saw the locahan on the other side of the glen so I knew I was at least 330 meter high.
<br>
<br>

It was wet very steep and I was worried that a slip on a wet rock could lead to me falling on it and breaking my leg or ankle. I was a bit scared and nervous now which drained my strength too.
<br>
<br>
But after much effort I reached the top and it got less steep and after a short time I saw a cairn and I was so relieved, I went up to it and kissed the top stone. 4 hours it had taken me. The cloud was coming and going on the way up and I was not sure if I would be able to see anything from the top. I watched the Stob a Chroin on the way up it is just short of being a munro but it had a cloud on top most of the way. 
<br>
<br>
But luckily it cleared a bit for me. I took a pic and looked at the map. I had 2 maps one old and a different one new. The new on had the summit a little to the west as 2 meters higher than were I was. So I descended a bit and climbed to the 2nd summit took anther pic. I hoped to see Chabhair from here but the cloud came back and I could see zilch. 
<br>
<br>
I was wet cold and nacked so I started down.
<br>
<br>
I rung out my socks at the first summit as best I could so my Feet did not feel so wet.
<br>
<br>
The problem was now How to get down.
<br>
<br>
I started the descant from the dip between the 2 summits and after a while of careful foot planting I descend enough to see the lochan a'chorin which was on the map but I could not see on the ascent as I climbed too far east to see it.
<br>
<br>
It was just a boggy bowl with a wee locahn in it looked like a quagmire. The rest of the hill was not much better. It was a bit sunnier now.
<br>
<br>
Towards the bottom of the hill I saw some deer, 3 or 4 moving very fast, I took a pic but they were a bit far away. How would anyone get close enough to shoot one?
<br>
<br>
I reached the car track much further away than when I started. I walked a good pace and reached the Ishag again in 15 mins. 
<br>
<br>
I tried to jump the ford with stepping stones for a laugh instead of using the bridge. I through my bag over so It would not unbalance me but It only just made it and It fell back in the water. I put it on anyway, I am wet enough was a few more wet things going to matter.
<br>
<br>
I was feeling physically good now and even had a few sprints on the way back. Which is strange for me - perhaps I am fitter than I thought.
<br>
<br>
I reached the car 38mins from the ishag, I was nacked and wet. And because of the ford incident the contents of my bag were wet and I had nothing dry to drive home in so I wore my rain jacket and a woolly hat to keep my groin warm. The car heater was put on full bung.
<br>
<br>
I got home in 1:45 with no traffic on the road that was pretty good.
<br>
This is probably the least enjoyable hill I have ever climbed.
<br>
Total walking time = 7 hours
