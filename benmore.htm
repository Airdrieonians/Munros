It was a beautiful Oct day. the sun was shining like it was going to burst.
It took me 1 hr 40 to get up to Callendar and on past Lochearnhead and turn towards
Crainlarich and I parked at the road side on the main road beside 4 or 5 other cars.

I started up towards Ben More at 11:00.

The Munro Book said it would be 2hr 40 but it was more like 3:26 for me. I met a couple 
coming down when I was close to the summit and they said it was 45 mins to go. I thought 
what mince. I have taken nearly 3 hr already it can not be that far. But when it seemed 
obvious it was that far I speeded up towards the end just to prove them wrong even if it 
by just 4 mins.

The going was very steep early on and the book said to follow a dyke. There was no dyke, 
what was the guy on about. There was no path either. So I just traversed left and right 
through the grass as I pleased. The grass was still covered in frost in some places. The 
sun had been up for 3hrs when I started. I was climbing the North face and the October 
sun was moving to the west and slowly coming round to catch part of the North slope. 
There was a big Ice cream scoop taken out of the north west side of the mountain. I tried 
to keep close to it to maximised the sun. There was only a few wispy clouds around. One 
over Glen Dochart where the main road ran and another between Ben More and the Cruach 
Adrain which I climbed earlier this year. Benmore burn ran between these mountains and 
about 1500 feet above, the cloud was hovering. But the sun was working on it and it got
smaller and smaller as time went on. The cloud over Glen Dochart was bigger but 
only slightly blocked my view. 


The view was magnificent. Loch Ibhair and Loch Dochart were side by side below me, linked 
by a small river. The smaller loch Dochart had a wee island in it, and on the island was 
a fairytale castle which was constantly in view for the whole 3 1/2 hr climb. I was
constantly trying to work out how high I was. I compared my height with the ridge leading
to Cruach Ardrain and with the opposite side of the Lochs. The map had a little lochan 
at 1300 ft on the opposite mountain and if I could see it, it proves I was higher. I was 
looking towards where it should be but the clouds were in the way. I reckoned I was 
higher by then, when I compared my height to the Cruach Ardrain ridge. After a while I 
looked a little to the right and saw a lochen and thought I had been looking at the wrong
place, but soon the cloud cleared and I could see one where I expected but due
to a small ridge in front of the lochan at 450 meters I would have to be significantly 
higher than this to see it.


By the time I reached 2000 feet I was well above the cloud line and a small monoprop plan 
flew along Glen Dochart. It is strange to look down on a plane flying past 1000 ft below you.


I took lots of rests and I find a wee bit of grass at the right incline for me to use my 
Rucksack as a pillow. I took out a "boost" bar and lying in the blazing sunshine in a 
beautiful location tasting the chocolate bar and feeling the sugar rush in my fatigued 
bloodstream was great. It made me wonder if some of the jokes about God being Scottish 
were true. 
You know, the one about the American guy touring the Cathedrals of Britain 
and he goes in to York minister and there is a big gold telephone on the wall with a 
sign saying "Phone God - only £10,000". He asks the Minister about this and he is assured 
that if he pays the £10,000 he can speak on the phone to god. He thinks this is too pricey.
On to the next Cathedral and the same thing. So he goes to St Giles in Edinburgh and sees
the same sort of phone but this time it said 5p to phone god. He gets hold of the Minister
and asks him about it. The Minister says  yes thats right 5p and you can speak to god. 
The American says but in England it is £10,000. Why the difference? The Minister says,
Yeah, I know but its a local call :-)

But just to cap it all I see that the moon is out and it is a complete semicircle. Its funny
how you feel you can actually see the outline of the semicircle not illuminated by the sun. 
This must be a trick your mind plays on you. 

There is some traffic noise but every now and again It sounds like I am on the set of TORN. 
The sound the motorbikes make is very loud even at 2000 feet. I watch them fly by overtaking
everyone on their way. They must be doing over 100 mph.

I can see in the far north west the tops of some more cracking hills. I'll climb them 
some day.

The guy who wrote the book went on about a path by some dyke that you could follow up the 
hillside.I had already decided he was talking mince. 

But while traversing I stumbled across a path. I wondered if there was a path all the way up
and I had tired myself fighting through the grass for nothing. But the length of the traverses
I was walking, made it impossible that I could have missed it. 

Great! a path, that makes life easier. After following it for a while it comes to a long line 
of stones running up the hill. It dawns on me this is what is left of the dyke. That book 
bloke was not talking mince after all. But the "dyke" started at such a height up the hill, 
he maybe should have said that in the text.

I could see what looked like a cliff at the top of the hill even from the bottom. It turned
out to be a series of large rocks. I assumed and hoped and prayed that was the summit. 
Sadly no. When I passed it, it was like climbing up the side of a house and walking on the
roof. The gradient was much shallower and the terrain was grassy again. Because the path 
took me further to the east side of the hill the wind now caught me for the first time today.
I was starting to get colder and had to put more clothes on. I put my new Airdrie(Utd) strip
on. this I would wear to the summit and christen it on a Munro. My previous strip has been
on top of a few Munros.

The summit was a huge rock. There is a triangulation point sitting on the rock and directly 
under it is a big cravas/cave, 4 or 5 people could get in it easy. There was a great view 
to the cloudless north that I had been starring at for the last 3 1/2 hrs and to the south 
was a carpet of cotton wool clouds. Poking through the cotton wool now and again
was the top of the odd mountain. 

The people on top, 2 young foreign men, a 40 odds couple
and a guy about my age, were trying to work out which peak was which, a man and his teenage
son arrived at the top and were told that Ben Lomond was in that direction. What mince, they
were pointing at Ben Vorlich by Loch Earn but I did not have the heart to put them right. 
I am not sure if any of the peaks were Lomond but the Sgur A'Chroin was defiantly one of 
them, you can read about my disaster day climb up there elsewhere on this site. 

It was now decision time. Do I have the time, the daylight, the energy, the food, the drink and 
the inclination to climb the next Munro, Stob Beinnin? It was 3PM now and it would be dark 
before 6:30Pm. The book said the 1000 feet drop and the climb to reclaim the height would
take an hour. Can I trust the book? I would like to leave 2 hrs for the decent. So I would
have to start the decent by 4PM ideally. I felt OK. I'll climb til 4 and if I am not at the
summit I'll turn back.

As I started to descend the ridge I met 3 men all late 40s early 50s, who looked a bit nacked. 
They had parked at Inverlochlairg and climbed from that side over Stob Beinnein and on to Ben
More. Basically the opposite to what I am doing, only I start and end at the same point. I 
hope they make it back before dusk.

I descend in 23 mins, so the book bloke is doing ok. The climb up to the Stob is hard and I 
take lots of stops and I start to feel exhausted. I take on some more chocolate and clamber
on. I get to the top at 4:10pm. I can see the Cruach Ardrain and Talaculian(sp?) to the 
south west. The last two hills I climbed,I think. One was a hard slog and the other was my
petrol scare episode.
I'll write about those stories later. I phoned for the Airdrie H-T Score, 1-0, and my
strip has got its 2nd Munro, the day is getting even better :-)

My decent went back to the lowest point between the mountains and then I drop down a crap
path to the floor of Benmore glen. I call again at 5:30 and we won 2-0. I am in my car by 
6:06, which narrowly beats my 2hr target.

As I drive back I am feeling hungry for real food, not the sanies I have with me. I stop at 
Stirling services and have hot tea and a baked beans/baked potato. It is good stuff. 
I am starting a tradition of this snack. I did the same after Stur A'Chorin.
