Tom Dubh (3,010ft)

Date : Fri 23-July-2021

 

Left Fife at 7:13am

Arrived Auchlean, Glen Feshie car park 9:50am. Time 2:37 Drive(With Stops)

Mid twenties DegC - super warm. The higher I get the cooler it will be.

I used my bike again like before to do the 1st K.

 

I came to do Monadh Mor or if I felt great when I reached Loch an Cnapan,

I could try the legandary Carn an t-Sabhail, the holy grail of Scottish Munros.

 

My planned times were Carn Ban Mor Bealach = 3Hours, Loch an Cnapan =4 hrs.

 

I was disapointed to be so slow on the ascent. It took an hour to get out the trees.

It took 2:30 to get to the stone shelter.

Folk were passing me all the time.Girl 20 and old dad were going to Sgor Goaith,

a brilliantly spectactular Munro. Moutain bikers too. Having to carry bikes sometimes.

 

I reached Carn Ban Mor bealach cairn at 3:54. Very bad! too slow.

Last Nov I did this in 2:45.

This blew my plans up in the air so I continued down hill towards the Cnapan

for a few minutes and sat and got the maps out to consider. I took 40 Min stop.

 

I could head south and take the Mullach Clach a' Bhlair Munro. But that is not why I'm here.

I'm here to train for the  Carn an t-Sabhail. I decided to head East into the Moine Mhor

as far as I could go and return when I get too tired. I need to know how boggy it is

and if the rivers are easy to cross.

 

I follow the great easy path bown towards the Alt Sgairnich. The path turns left to

join a tractor track,(half hour from the Carn Ban Mor bealach) there are dried up

bogs everywhere.

2 months with no rain has done the trick. Makes walking a lot easier.

 

At the end of the road is a large oblong of road at the side of the river Alt Sgairnich.

I decend to the waters edge and look for stones to cross the river.

I find it surprisingly easy to cross.

 

I want to head for the Loch an Cnapan which is slightly more than half way to the

Carn an t-Sabhail. Over dried bogs I get there easily( 1 hour from Carn Ban Mor bealach,

5:38 on the hill) , very tired though.

I lie down and rest for 30 mins in the blazing sunshine.

Even at 3Kft high the heat is strong.

 

I decide I'm too tired to do anymore and want to head back.

But before I go I need to learn  more about Monadh Mor.

I need to cross another river Allt Luineag.

 

I walk slowly round the NorthEast edge of Tom Dubh and mangage with some

difficulty to cross river Allt Luineag.

I walk down the East side of towards where the book told me to cross.

 

I see heading speedily down the NorthWest flank of Monadh Mor a guy in bright yellow,

He sweeps past and I take a photo of him crossing the river on the offical path route.

He splashes a bit and nearly falls in. I nearly laugh!.

He asks if I got a pic of him falling, I said I did.

He did the Monadh Mor and to a double cairn. This might be the Munro further on.

He looks strange with 2 watter bottles straped to his cheast with straw in each.

I met him on the climb to Carn Ban Mor.

 

Finding water is easy on Mione Mhor. I had water purifaction tabs which work a treat.

 

I think about if I have enough energy and daylight to do Monadh Mor and get back b4 dark.

 

I decide to call it a day and go back, no Munro today. I climb Tom Dubh and call it my

summit for the day.

 

I cross Alt Sgairnich again, and rest at the oblong of road.

I saw 2 in blue at the Loch an Cnapan when I was doing Tom Dubh.

I see them again now approaching  Alt Sgairnich I think they will pass me soon

and I'm sure they must have done Carn an t-Sabhail else where did they come from?

 

They never pass me. They must have gon accross the bog, perhaps thay think using

a road in sacrelige.

I start waking back uo the road and cut off the corner to the path walking over

dried bogs. I see them again in the bogs. I stop on the path as thay are moving

quite slow.

 

They eventually catch me up. They did Carn an t-Sabhail & Sgor a Lochain Uaine.

Father and son. I let them walk on. After a time I follow them.

 

I want to get back to the Beleach in no more thandouble the time it took(1 hour)

to Cnapan. I get back in 1:42 (8:31 on the hill). I see someone else in blue

following me and she catches me at the watting hole at top of Alt Fhearnagan .

She not only did the Carn an t-Sabhail but the devils point.

Respect!

I get my poles out and soon need my right knee brace too, I eventuall catch and

pass both groups and get back to car with bike at 9:55 in the hill.

What a day, "I will be back" as Arnie says.

 1:24 decent
 
 9:55 on the hill
