Fri 20 Aug 2004 - Beinn a'Chleibh & Ben Lui
<br>
<br>
<br>
I failed the Carn Mor Dearg in May and the Beinn Chabhair last Friday because I was not fit enough. So I did not want a repeat today. It took 2hr 45min to drive there from work arrived 3:45 ish. The Lochearn road was blocked due to a landslip and I was forced to go the Loch Lomand road which is 20mins slower.
<br>
<br>
Jim Wilson came along with me which is good cos I feel safer if I am not alone. Jim did the Carn Mor Dearg when I tried it in May and did Nevis too for good measure. I waited 5 hours for him at the bottom. 
<br><br>
But today we had to find the car park which was not easy and then crose the burn in Glen Lochy. It was supposed to have stepping stones to let you cross but it was too high for that so we took the boots off and waded across. We were surprised we had to cross the railway too. This took us into a forests. We followed a burn at a slight incline. It was sunny but not too warm. This forest was lasting a while and I was surprised it took so long to reach the edge. I was beginning to think we were on the wong path. But after 45min we reached the stile which took us on to the hill. It was a bit boggy in places which held up our progress having to jump waterlogged ground.
<br><br>
Going was steeper now but we made fair progress. Jim wanted to head straight for the Lui but I was looking dong the lower peak a'Chliebh cos I was not sure if I had the legs for them both. We headed round the edge of the Lui's ower slopes and could see the col between the hills and it did not look too taxing. The view down Glen Lochy towards Loch Awe was cracking. I cycled this way when I was 17-18, from Tyndrum to Dalmally and on to Oban. 
<br><br>
The path had basiccally disapeared at this point and we walked through the grass and made our own way. We guessimated we could be on the the col in a furthur 20mins. We reached the last climb before the col and it was a steep tester. I needed an fair break before trying it. I sat on a stone and got out a picnic bar. It was great. We had used our 20 mins already and it took me a we while to struggle up to the col but I got there and lay behind a rock to rest. We had been walking for 2 hours now. The Munro book said we should be a t the summit in that time.
<br><br>
It was not far to the top but it was fairly steep but we got there in 2h 30m. It was windy now but I was just glad to get a Munro after 2 failures and a summer without transport. I had my digi camera with me so I put on my Airdrie top to get a pic at the top. Jim took the photy but said the can#mera was not working, I looked at it and it said "battery depleted" - Dam!
<br>
We head down again quickly. Jim was not sure if I was going to try the Lui. I felt tired but I had a bit left in the tank and I had to give it a go and see if I could make it. We calculated when we reached the col after 3hr on the stot that we had 40 mins to get to the top of then Lui if we were to get back to the car in daylight. This was 7pm. We started up Lui and after 20mins a cloud came over and it started to rain. I could see it was raining to the north west but it was an isolated dark cloud and hoped it would pass by missing us. We walked through the rain and and it was dry again in 15 mins. We had used our 40mins bu we were so close to the top we were not stopping now. The cloud was still with us at the top but it had taken 1 hour from the col and we were in daylight trouble and we know it. Because of the cloud we did not know where the summit was exactly so I got the map and compass out and decided it was south-ish. We clambered over some rocks and found a cairn(It had taken 4hours to get to the top of Lui.). I has seen the cairn from Beinn a'Cliebh but I was not totally sure this was it.  So we stayed a few minuted hoping the cloud would clear. It did a little and we could look to the North but the south was still obscured. We fould that we were on the eadge of a huge cliff. It would have been cracken to see the clear view but daylight was running out and we had to skidadle. 
<br><br>
We rached the eage of the forrest in an hour and it was twilight already, and it was a tad after 9pm. We almost raced down the burn path jumping the soggy bits, which drained my remaining streangth. At the burn near the car park we were not mucking arround trying to keep drylike we had on the way up. I tried to stting stones it but near the other side I ran out of stones. Jim ust jumped in and washed the muck from his boots and legs. I was forced to jump in to for the last 15 feet to the bank.
<br><br>
The car park has a camper van in it and the folk were asleep but the wee dog they had heard us and started yelping like a mad thing and they wolk and looked out the windows at us. I waved, the guy waved back. It was seriously dark by now but we had nicked back just in time.

Total time walking time 5hours 45mins
