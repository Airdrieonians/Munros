Sgor Gaoith (#75)


Left Fife earliest ever at 7:11am.
Darkness falls at 4:30 after a bit of gloaming, 
so need to be there at dawn or soon after, 
else walk down on the dark.
I have torches just in case.

The sun is spitting the trees.
Forecast said it would be 6Deg C on top.
Fantastic day! Scotland in November! How would have thought?


Arrived at Achlean car park in Glen Feshie near Aviemore at 9:20.

I had my bike in the back of the car, I cycled south toward Achlean.
Through a gate on the left (East) towards the forrest.
A guy on a moutian bike followed me. He was cycling down Glen 
Feashie on a good cycle track.
He said I would not be able to cycle far on my hybrid road bike, 
best to plank it in the wood.

I chained the bike to a tree by the track.

The bike gave me a flying start as withing 30 mins of me 
following the track through the wood I was over taken by 2 groups 
of folk I  saw leave from the car park before me.
An ugly looking guy on his own and a North Ameriacan sounding guy with 
his nice fair haired labrador dog.

The track was well  maintained , it makes a great difference to walk 
on a good path.

Another guy came up to paass me as I sat on a big rock by a half 
crescent rock shelter. He was from Milnathorpe in Fife, he had been 
up these hills many times before.

Then 4 off  30-something women and a black dog passed me too.

There are far to many people on this track for my liking.

I chose a route which is not the the #01 route in the guide 
book so  was not expecting much company.

I am high enough now (1:45mins)to see over the shoulder of 
the ridge to the guide book track to the north. I see a white 
speck moving along the path.

After 2 hours I am nearing the top of the climb which 
veers closer to the top of the Alt & Coire Fhearnagan.


I know that when I reaech the top of the ridge and start 
to decsnd I will head North along the Carn Ban More Ridge 
to Sgor Gaoith summit.
This could feasibly be part of the way to M004 Cairn Toul.
Which I plan to climb in the next few years.

The top of the pass has a big cairn(2Hours 45mins) and the 
4 witches who past me earlier are there with an imaginary 
couldron at the centre of their circle.

I stop and take pics and have a jam sanie(Sair Hawn).
They ask me to take their pic. I do.
A single woman with poles and her 2 dogs pass me now.

I head north now 1.5 miles to the summit.
I go off pist to the east to take away the need to climb to 
the top of Carn Ban More.

I see moutain bikers pass.

There has been planes and gliders flying about all day and
 I get a good view of them again.
There is a gliding club in Glen Feashie.

The summit of Sgor Gaoith is magnificent with rock columns 
above Loch Einich which is a shear drop down the cliff edge.
This is one of the best Munros I have ever seen.

The summit is busy.Too many folk for my liking.
Young folk in running gear with no rucksack or mountain equipment.

Time to summit 3 hours 45mins. A good time for me! 
My First ever November Munro!

I stay on top for half hour. Scary looking over the cliff edge.


Older guy wants to have a goood moan about these irresponsable 
young folk, if the clouds come down they will all die he says.
He says its a disgrace in the car park by the bridge, 
i.e.starting point in the guide book, folk parking on verges 
and all over the place. He says he was in the Army. 
I can see that.

I retrace my steps to get down. The Fife guy says he is going to 
another hill nearby before going back.
I want to do Cairn Toul from this side, some day. 
He says its best to do it from Linn of Dee, Cycle to the lodge 
and climb the Devils Point 1st. I'm no so sure about that.

I see no one on my fast decent.
Until I nearly reach the wood. 2 young guys going slow, I over 
take them and reteive my bike.
While I do that they pass me.
I'm on the bike and sprint past them back to the car.
5 Hours 54 mins on the hill and 30 mins of light then gloaming left.

I see there is another Munro I can do from this starting point.
Cycle a few miles down the glen following the Feashie river.
Looks a good one for the future.
