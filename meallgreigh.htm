Sun 18-AUG-2013

Left home at Noon.(Late!)

Got to Ben Lawer Hotel carpark 14:00.(Made good time)

Walked west down road to Horn carver cottage then up through Farm.
Into the forest fighting past the ferns.

45 mins to get to end of forest and start out on the open hillside.

Followed Ben Lawers burn for a mile.Did not cross it at the bridge.
Went a little further then started up a steep grassy slope.
It starts raining a little. Its very windy. That why we did not got straight up 
form the forest. tried to keep shelterd as log as poss.

Hard climb - no path. Slow going.
Saw couple comming down. They said they had done An Stuc and Meall Garbh before 
this one and on the way back down. They were at the summit 30 min ago. So I guess 
we will get there in an hour (it actually took 1:15).

Wind gets worse the higher we go.
We head for the ridge to get out of the wind a bit then walk west into it.

Get to summit in 3:15.

There seems to be another cairn a bit further on.
Difficult to see if it is higher than this one.
We go there and find it is much lower.
Then quickly back down the hill as the windy is doing my head in.

Lesley waits and takes lots of photos.

We go back due east. down the Sgor Mhor. direct to the forest again.

Very steep decent. Glad we did not come up this way.

3 hr to come off the hill.

6hrs 15 mins on hill

Back to Ben Lawers hotel at 8:15PM
