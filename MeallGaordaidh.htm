We left Edinburgh @ 8AM and started walking @ 10:15AM. This Munro is in Glen Lochay, 
<br>which runs West from the village of Killin.
We parked on the side of the road close to a bridge over the Allt Dhuin Croisg, 
<br>close to where it flows into the River Lochay.
<br>
<br>There is a path heading north following the Allt, it veers more westernly as
<br> we progress and becomes less defined.
The weather is dry and initially the cloud is higher than the Corbett Creag an Tulabhain. 
<br>It is surprisingly warm 12Deg.
I am finding it harder to keep up with the others and fall back a bit. Andy and 
<br>Doogie drop back with me.
<br>It is so warm I take my trousers off and walk in my shorts. Doogie swapped rucksacks 
<br>with me as his was lighter.
<br>
<br>The cloud base lowers a bit and I can not see the top of the Corbett anymore. As we get
<br> higher snow fields become more frequent.
Walking in snow is more tiring. I try to skirt round the snow. We are in the cloud by now but we 
<br>are close to the top.
The others go on ahead and I come over the top of a ridge and see them at the top. Doogie waves 
<br>and I raise my arms and clench fists in salute. I put on the latest Airdrie Away top and 
<br>reach the trigulation point 
<br>which has a dry stone wall circled round it.
<br>Doogie is standing on top of the trig point and I follow him and lots of pics get taken.
<br>
<br>
Time to top 2 Hours 52 Mins.(Book time 2:30)
<br>
We met 3 older blokes on the top, they started from the Tullich House a bit farther up Glen 
<br>Lochay.
<br>After a few minutes on the top the cloud breaks a little and soon it is completely clear. <br>More pics as I can see Glen Lyon clearly
<br>now and the hills beyond. To the East I can see the Ben Lawers range.
<br>
<br>On the way down we chose the east side of the hill. There were large snow fields on that side <br>and Doogie and Andy were sliding down it.
<br>I was a bit fearfull at first but after seeing them it was clear it was not dangerous. <br>Snowball fights started and it was great fun in the bright sunshine.
<br>
<br>Doogie collected frog spawn on the way back down. and we were back at the car by 3:30PM.
<br>It would not get dark until 6:30PM so we started off far too early.
<br>
<br>Stopped off at a pub in Killin beside the bridge and the waterfall and rapids. Sat outside in <br>the sunshine. Guy next to me was talking about the
<br>England/Scotland rugby game that was kicking of a 6PM. Scotland lost as expected.
