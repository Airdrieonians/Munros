Sederant: Jim Wilson

Drove for 1:50Hr to A85 opposite Ben More. 
Started walking at 2:38PM. from Auchean Farm<br>
Sunny with some cloud cover, 15-20 degrees

Took it slow and steady, I new were I was going cos of Meall Glas last month
follows the same route most of the way.

Crossed the Allt Riob..h and found the grave by the dirt road. 1:25Hrs

The hill started climbing more steeply from there.

We saw a route through the rocks straight up to the summit.
We saw a guy with a long thing yellow paracute circling higher.
He floated miles away in no time.

We were hasselled a wee bit with midgies, the sun was mosly behind cloud but 
as we got near the top it came out more. Last bit was steepest and my pulse 
went to 160 for first time today.

Very rocky top with cliff on south side. We circle abit to the north to avoid 
them and reach top at 5:25PM after 2:45 min climb - faster and easier than I 
had thought. Took some pics and headed back after 15 mins.

Back to car at 7:30PM, 4:50Hrs on the hill.

Think of doing Anoch Mor & Beag at Glen Nevis next, but will have to be whole day
not Friday afternoon effort. If Fri is only time to go then Ben Challum is next.
