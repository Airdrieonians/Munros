Broad Cairn & Cairn Bannoch #89 & #90

Fri 20-SEP-2024
                       
Left Fife 8:13. Stops at Perth Tesco & Glenshee.
Full Sun 15 Deg. It did rain on the journey up.

Got to car park at spittal of Glen Muick at 11:11am.
Â£5 fee for car park.
                       
Used bike along the tractor track on south side of Loch Muick, 
until about half way, Black Burn, 2 miles took 32 mins.
                       
I planked the bike and headed up a steep ziz zag tractor track 
to the shoulder of the ridge, which took another 1 hour.
                       
The folk I had passes on the bike never followed me up the steep climb, 
they must have gone further along the path right by the loch.
                       
Great views over towards LochNaGar.

2 miles more on this tractor track to the shed at the base of the climb for Broad Cairn.
                       
I could hear loud cow moos.
I could see them very far away on the south horizon.
                       
The wind starts to catch me and I cool down and put on my Airdrie shirt..
The wind is blowing up the south Esk Glen towards me.
When I get further on, the Cairn Broadlands to Cairn Damff ridge protects me from it.
  I meet my 1st walkers here, 4 of them,, 20 somethings, 2 couples.
                       
I reach the shed, with range rover and 2 horses after 2 hr 30mins.
This is the start of the climb proper.
                       
There is a bank of cloud or mist in Glen South Esk.
I'm higher than the mist , but it is moving towards me.
                       
A well maintained path takes me to 2,786 feet, 
then across the plateau to the boulder stroun summit. Difficult walking over the rocks.
Reach summit, 4 Hrs 5Mins.
                       
My Mobile phone has died a few mins before the summit.
So no summit photo.
I think about calling it a day and going back.
I can see the Cairn Bannoch , not too far distant.
I surely must walk towards it to see if I have the energy to collect my 2nd Munro of the day.
                       
 I see 3 walkers coming towards me , Then I meet a 4th.
 He is from Leven in Fife and will have a kid in Nov and is doing the complete circuit 
starting at LochnaGar. He shows me a pic of him at Loch nan Eun. He is very proud of. 
 The other 3 walker pass.
I'm well set towrds Cairn Bannoch now.
I dump my rucksack and walk with only poles and water bottle.
I reach Cairn Bannoch 4 Hrs 55 mins.
                       
I'm in luck, a walker called Gem and her wee dog are at the summit and she agrees 
to take my photo and send it to me by WhattsApp.
She has started at LochNaGar too.
                       
I retrace my steps to the rucksack, then skirt the north side of Broad Cairn to avoid 
more climbing and slowly pick my way across the boulders to reach the path above the shed.
                       
The mist has come down to the path level now.
Visability is now 30 yrds.
I walk through it.
I don't want to retrace my steps to the bike along the tractor track.
More interestingly, I drop down the path to the ridge to Loch Muick.
                       
As I lose height , I pass under the massive finger of mist and can clearly see Loch Muick now.
A great experiance to be on the v steep banks of the Loch with billowing mist above me.                                             
I decend the clear path to the shore of Loch Muick, in 35 mins. 7:15 into the walk. 

I see a great house in trees on the North side of the Loch.
I'm tired now and pick my way along the shore path towards the bike. 
I see a sandy buldge on the shore ahead and correctly think this is the out flow 
of the Black Burn where my Bike is.

It has taken me 25 mins on the shore path to reach bike.
It is starting getting dark now.
I pour water from the burn to cool my sweaty head and cycle back to car in 16 mins.
Passing a few surprised late stragglers on the path.
 I don't pass Gem and her dog, I thought I might catch her up.

Reach car after 8:05 on the hill.
