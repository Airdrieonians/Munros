Creag Pitridh (Loch Laggan) (#86)(M-264)
[Peter's Rock]

Date : Wed 09-Aug-2023

Left Fife at 08:24am

Arrived Car Park west of bridge over river spean west of Loch Laggan car park 10:50:  2:66 Drive.(comfort Stops at Azda Pertha nd Wolktrax loch laggan)
I couldn't get in the car park east of the bridge , full up.
14 DegC. It will be 10Deg at the summit

Used bike for 1st km. Over bridge good tractor track as far as gradiaent was too much and I locked and hid bike out of sight.

Folk loaded with camping gear were comming from the west near the small resoivoir. This must be a long distance path folk use.

i see what could be baby stoats or baby squirells crossing the path in front of me. 

The good tractor track ran all the way to the beach at the west end of Lochan Na H-Earba.Got there 1:07.
No climbing neccessary unil the base of the climb was reached in 1:15.

I notice folk have come this far with bikes. a set of 2 and a 3rd are sitting by the fast flowing burn Allt Choire Pitridh.
So at least 3 folk are up these hills. I keep a keen eye out but I don't see anyone.

A bit of wind, no sun, not too hot, good conditions for a climb.

25 mins into the climb I reach a ford of the Allt Choire Pitridh.
There is another smaller fors 15 mins later. 

This is a good path that takes me very near the  belach between Beinn a' Chlachair and Geal Charn.

I reach it after 2:38, a disappontingly slow time. 
I do start to get worried that I have missed the cross road with the Westerly path to the bealach between 
Creag Pitrihd and Glean Charn. releved to find it.
A large rock is nearby and someone has placed there rucksack there, coming back to collect on way down I expect.

I can see the summit of Creag Pitridh very well now it doesn't seem that far away.
I see a tall person on the summit. Perhaps that is one of the bikers.

I try to find the best place to leave the path and freestyle over the heather to get to the summit mound.
When the little hump(830m) in front of me is in line with the summit seems a good place to leave path.

I had hoped I could do Glen Charn and Creag Pitridh but I do not feel stong enough.

I had a wee bit nausea on the way up and decided to bag one instead of trying 2 and getting exhausted.

At the base of the summit mound I see a guy and dog comming off Glean Charn crossing the path at the 
part where it is in a cutting.

He is fast. I can't let him  beat me to the summit.

I have my locator app on telling me the atlitude, its 840m not far to go to 924 at summit.

Reach summit 3:40. 

Could see all the lochs around and the 2 nighbouring Munros in this 3 hill group. 
spent 23 mins on summit

I headed down the way the guy with the dog went.
He said he did the 3 Munros today in the correct order.

A little path near the summit then feeestyle walking through heather and rocks. 
Wet in places.

It took me 53Minutes to get down to the main Ford on Allt Choire Pitridh.
Good time I think. 
 

5:59 on the hill.
