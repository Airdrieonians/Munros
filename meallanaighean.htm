Meall na Aighean & Carn Mairg

Left home 9am, stopped of in Kinross for sanies.

Got to Invervar 11:10. 

3 cars were already in a 6 berth car park. 
Girl with horse, poopping in the car park.

The defined entrance to the path up the hill was fenced off with a sign to go via Lint Mill.
It did not say which direcion or where this was so I just walked up a driveway to a big house and louped the fence to the pathway.

The path went through a wooded area but nearly all the trees had been felled.
Some were placed over the walkers path. By acident or design?

The big stiles had no poll to help you when on top, so I used the gates.

There were big signs telling you to follow path with green/orange polls.

These assume you would be going round the 4 Munro horseshoe clockwise.
I was on a tractor path when I came to a Alt stream.

This means I have gone too far, as I wanted to go up the 1st Munro in the antiClock wise direction.

A very organised couple, come from behind me and they said I had already pased the path up that hill,
 so I back tracked and went up another tractor track, the map was saying jump up the hill here.
There was no path so at a gate I climbed up a steep slope by a fence.
I continued on hoping to find the crest of the main ridge where the map said the path was.

It took quite some time to plough through the heather. It was tiring me out.

I ploughed on and came upon a faint path. Great. I soon came upon an all teraine buggy vehicle.
This would be the stakers transport.

The wind was strong comming from my left (North/Northwest).

I pulled the fleece hat tight over my ears.

I knew there were 3 groups ahead going clockwise and the couple I met makes 4.
I wondered when I might meet thm coming the other way.

The hill top I could see easily and impresively ahead turned out to be Carn Mairg. 
As I followed the path it was bending right which made the wind blow more and more into my back.
Great! that helps , it blows me up the hill.

It seemed more unlikely that the summit I can see is the one I wanted, as it semed to go on a  bealach before rising agin.

A new summit on my righ appeared in view .
This made more sense, it was the 1st Munro of the day Meall na Aighean.

I was making good progress now and I met my 1st visitor of the day.
Single guy with polls coming down to finish.

Soon I met a younger couple when I was nearing the summit.
I said I had taken over 2 hours to this point. (Acually 2:27 but I didn't want to say how slow I was.
She asked does that mean there was 2 more hours for her to go.?
I said no, its half the time going down and they could be back in less then an hour.

I bang on and reach the summit. (2 hours 48 mins)
I had thought of cutting across to the 850m beleach and climing the higher hill 1st while I was less tired.
But in terms of moral, I would be happer in the knowleage I had a Munro in my pocket before taking on the 1042m Carn Mairg.

I knew I need to rest to recover so I decided to stay at the summit of Meall na Aighean for 30 mins to rest.
I went round to the south side of the summit cairn and found a flat angled slab to rest my back againt out of the annoying wind.

I took pics of Ben Lawers range to the south and Schehallion to the north east.
It was bright sunshine.
I changed my sweaty t-shirt for new ones and wished I had a hot flask of tea with me. Andy Phillips always had one.
This was the Fisrt Munro I had done alone for 10 years!

I was strting to fell abit chilly so I headed off towards the next Munro.
I verrred left a bit to avoid an Alt and head straight down the slope to the 850m beleach.

I met anothe single guy coming down with polls. He was stockier than the 1st guy.
He said it was freezing on top of Carn Mairg and he felt the really harsh wind after his 1st Munro of the day Carn Gorm(Glen Lochy).

I sa him dissappear towards the beleach as I continued the climb to Carn Mairg.

I thought it might take 30 mins to go the mile from Meall an Aighean to the Carn Mairg. 
It took 30 mins to get to the base of the cracking rock cluster that is the summit of Carn Mairg.
I'm sure I heard a human voice here. I looked arround and saw nothing but sheep.
Perhaps it was a sheep noise I heard.

I had 2 choices now. There was a direct very steep grassy slope parting the rocks in front of me or a less steep grass path to my left. I went the left route.
It was relativily easy to get to the highest point of the grass, but now the slope was going down hill. That is a no, no. 
I look right at a very steep bundle of big rocks. I started to climb them. Trying to find the simplest and safest route. I was three quarters way up and had to have a seat on a comforable rock and I took my pulse. It was 100bpm. I stopped and waited for it to go down to 80 before continuing. 
Only a short way now and I could see over the top to the summit cairn of Carn Mairg.
I gingerly traversed the last of the rocks. Now over the edge I was no longer sheltered and got blasted by the wind.

I quickly got to the cairn (4 hours 35 mins) took a selfie, A few more pics and I was not hanging arround this time, I was desperate to head home. I decended the very steep grassy slope which I had avoided on the ascent. It was slow going. After my fall on the Meall Chaich at drumochter a few month ago ,I decend with polls and am now much more carfull and slower.

I got to the bottom of the slope and back on the path, and powered home wards.

I saw 2 figures at the summit of Meall an Aighean. I thought these were folks following in mu footsteps. The last remaining group which was a couple could not have passed me without me noticing.

I try to trace my route on the mountain sholder in front of me. I see a column stack cairn ahead. I remember it from the pics I saw on the Walking Highlands website.
It did not seem to have a path going past it and was to far right of the route I chose.
So I ignored it and powered on up the last slope of the day. I got near the crest of the slope and saw that a path went down towards the column stack cairn behins me.

I'm on the path now and I can see the couple who I recently spotted at the summit of Meall an Aighean. I chase them. I get closer and closer. I want to stay with them so they can guide me down as my ascent was haphazard and not the way I want to go back to the car.

I can see the tracktor Track now and the have beaten me, as they are at the first gate into the decimated wood. I follow them. The path then goes to the correct entrance to the hill by passing an old mill building. Again I recognise this as a pic I saw on Walking Highlands.

I make it back to the Car. 2 hours to get down, 6 hours 30 mins on hill.
Mine was the only car in the car park. The couple I was chasing was te 4th group I met going up. The voice I heard at the base of Carn Mairg must have been her as she sneaked past me.

Great day, very hard . felt stomach craps, nausea on occassion but just rested to recover.
Well worth it in the end. My last of 5 Munros in the year and 69th Total.
All set to break the 70 barrier next Spring 2020.
