Beinn Chabhair

Fri 13-MAY-2005

Drove for 2:10Hr, 88miles (road works on Callander road slowed me up) from work to 
Drovers inn, Loch Lomandside

Started walking at 2:50PM. 
Sunny about 16 deg

I tried this Munro last Aug as soon a I bought my car.
I walked for 3 hour and did not reach the Loachan.
I was pretty unfit after a summer of no hills and no transport and
it was a scorching day must have been 25 degrees.

The first 1000 ft behind ben glas farm is perhaps the steepest I have seen.
It took me 48 minutes this time.
I talked to 2 English walker with ski poles who had done the Lawers ridge yeterday
They said it was 1:30 from Lochan to summit(30mins more than I thought). and 6 hrs all in.

2 scots guys in there 20s passed me before the top of thge 1st 1000ft.

When I got on the plateau I tried to walk fast to ensure I got to the lochan in 2 hrs.
Bit boggy, had to jump and skip over wet bits - tyers you out.
I reached the point where it had taken me 3hrs last aug and time was 1:30. Good sign. 
twice the speed

I was despeate to see the Lochan now. I was felling fairly weak and did not fell up to it 
and considered packing it in but I can not turn back twice on same hill.
I will walk till the daylight I need to return is all that is left.

The Lochan comes apon you v.quickly .
One moment it is not there the next it is.
Delight at seeing lochan at 2Hrs.

I have seen the 2 young guys earlier a few times on a far off ridge.
But they are nowhere to be seen now.
I am unsure which direction to start waking to the summit cos it is not clear 
where on the big long jaggy hill the summit is.
I look at the map and try o work out with the help of the shap of the lochan 
which direction I should be going.

I walk round a few ridges to get a better view before heading up the hill.
I see the two guys sitting in a burn crvice eating dinner.
I wave to them and they wave back.

I continue on up the hill and feel hugery and tired. I stop for tea too.
I am hoping they start up the hill and I can follow them.

They go what looks to me to be a hard way. I have sportted a route which
seem to be gully after gully, which is best in term of steepness.

I soldier on and on, til I unexpectantly reach the ridge path which runs over
all the tops. I look down to the west and see a cracking lochan really high about a 
mile away. It is on the map and the summit there is 715 meters. So I rekon I am 800meters

It is aridge walk now and i am certain the hard work is done. But I have no idea which top is the summit. After a bit I hear some shouts and look over to see my 2 pals from before on the summit about 3 tops ahead. I know its not far now.

I reach summit at 3:30hrs. (book time 2:50)

I have a chat with then guys an they take  my pic for me.
They had just phone their mate who was with them a few week ago when they reached the
Lochan to find the whole place in cluod and bad weather, so they went back.
They were taking about doing the ridge walk to the high lochan - that is hard.

Great views of Castiel, Cruach Ardrain, Stob beinnin, to the east.

I retraced my route fairly sharpish cause daylight will go in 3hrs or so.

I am getting tired on the boogy bit going back, glad to get to top of first 1000ft ridge.
It has taken an 1hr from Lochan 1:55 from top. another 35 mins takes me down the steep 
ridge and back to car. My eastimate 2Hr return time becomes 2:30. Glad I was not banking 
on that estimate for daylight.

Got back to car after 6hrs on hills

This was the last of the Loch Lomand hills. I started with Ben Lomand in 1993!

Drove back via Glasgow, time: 2hrs, distance bit more than going.
No advantage if I had come this way in the busy day time. Even with road works on Callander road.
