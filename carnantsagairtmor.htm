Carn an t-Sagairt Mor

Sat 25-JULY-2009


Started walk in car park off A93 5 miles north of Glenshee ski centre @ 12:05PM with Andy Phillips
We had a nice snack at the Ski Centre Cafe on the way :-)

Sunny - some cloud -  18 Degrees

Its a 3 miles flat walk on a good track following the Callater burn.
Reached Loch Callater in 1 hr. (33 mins to bridge accross the Callater burn)
2 mountain bikers pass us at the bridge.

There is a bothy there and a private house.
A dingy was in the Loch, and there were tents by the Lochside.

We climb up the left side of the loch getting high quite quickly

It then levels out and it is a steady gradient til the end of the Loch.
We pass 2 folk half way along the lochside. They are shouting to their pals in the dingy.
We can hear the voices from the loch quite well despite being perhaps half a mile away.

We go left round the end of the hill and meet 3 guys comming down, a bit apart from each other.

On the right Andy spots a deer, I dont see it too well right away but have to search for it.
Its on its own, moving slowly. I do not see any antlers, so might be young or a female.

Great view down Glen Callater, trying to follow line of path to Glen Clova with a squinty eye.

The path gets steep now and it is hard graft to keep going. We are 1 hr from the bothy.

We can see Cairnwell off to our right, with its aeriels, masts etc

We pass the path that skirts round Carn an t-Sagairt Mor. So we leave it and follow the metal fence posts
which lead straight to the summit.

There is a strange bit of machinery on the ground, it looks like part of a aircraft (or UFO? :-)
Mostly circular.
We then see a bigger bit which looks like a wing. It has graphetti all over it.
We wonder how long it has been there. There is a 1983 signature - we dont believe its been there that long.
We add our own messages and photograph them. [wreckage of plane crash in 1959 - 2 dead, see http://www.aircrashsites-scotland.co.uk/canberra_c-t-sagairt-mor.htm]

Counting the number of fence posts to the horizon. - 8.
When we get to number 8, after much suffering, there is another 4.

We soldier on and after the 4 there is a few more and a Cairn!! - Huraah!!

We reach Summit at 3:40PM, 3 hrs 35 mins.
There is a second identical cairn to the right, about 60 yds away, a guy is sitting by it.
We go over there, but before we get there a Glider comes into view really close. We 3 all try to get pics.

Bloke  says he has done Broad Cairn, Carn Bannoch and this one already today - what a trek!
He was heading towards Carn a Coire Boidieach and Cac Cairn Beag to finish of the day. That sort of day would kill me.

I do want to do Carn a Coire Boidieach, which we can see right in front of us.
Book says 1hr more. Down 70-80 feet then up the same and a bit more.
Andy is not for it. I am tired too, but I would have liked to do it.
But decided to leave it for another day.

We had a wee visitation by very tame hares. They came really close and did not run away as you would expect.

I went over to see the Dubh Loch Corrie better and took some pics - it looks great.
See some more wreckage, whole plan up here - wonder if anyone died.

We start heading back and get to the Bothy in a fast 1 hr decent.

Took more pics at the bridge by the Loch and headed back to car.
Arrived 6:50 PM.
