Ben Dubhcraigh and Ben Oss

Fri 15-Jul-2005

Started walk at Tyndrum, car park south of main road @ 2pm

Good weather with Jim Wilson,
long drag upto hill.
Done Ben Dubhcraigh, felt quite tired.
No sure if we should do Oss aswell.
Went for it.
Got a little lots and antious,
became exhausted. 
staggered to top of Oss.
Droped west into glen instead of retracing steps since it seemed easyer.
by the time I got down to the Glen floor, I pucked with exhaustion.
joined tractor track, kept walking,
Came to Farm, I decide I could not contine.
Farmer not in, no help there
Light was fading.
I sent Jim back to car so he could drive up to collet me.
But not sure if gates across track would be locked.
I phoned Police.
Police and Jim Arrived at same time - saved!
Stoped of at pub in Crainlarich fo sugry tea to revive.
Scary day cos I was not fit enough.
Did not do another Munro for 2 years.
