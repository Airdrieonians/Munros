Braeriach 
<br>
<br>

I drove me and Andy up towards the Ski Centre at Avimore. At one of the sharp bends in the road there is a
car park which is the best place to start for walking in the Cairngorm range.
<br>
<br>
It was a fairly long walk to reach Braeriach, It was a long incline up to a long thin rocky cleft. This passed out onto
a slight downhill section which fell into a glen with a burn running trough it.
Only after crossing the burn does the Munro actually start.
This was a bright very warm day. And we were getting tired.
<br>
<br>
We struggled up Braeriach. I amazing suggested walking on to the next top Cairn Toul which we could see from Braeriach.
But Andy did not fancy it, we were too nackered.
<br>
<br>
So we climbed down again and As I got close to the rocky cleft again I started feeling light headed and weak.
<br>
<br>
I stopped in the cleft as it was shaded and rested. I started to feel sick and puked there and then. I was shivering despite the heat.
Andy took my bag and after a bit of a rest I walked alittle way. I constantly thought I was going to faint.
I could only walk short distances at a time before resting. I would lie down and shiver for a few minutes then I would try to walk some more.
Andy patiently watched and waited as we progressed.
<br>
<br>
Close to the car park there is a wooden bridge and when I reached it I knew I would be able to get to the car and go home.
I lay down on the bridge and gave the mountain 2 fingers and shouted "Fuck you, you bastard".
<br>
<br>
I climbed into the back of my car with a polly bag in front of my face to collect the sick and Andy had to drive my car home.
<br>
<br>
The problem was of course sunstroke. I have experienced it once before when I was young on a long sunny bike ride.
But now I and fairly bald and I needed a hat to stop my head getting too hot. That was the problem.
So from then to now I will always were a baseball hat regardless of how hot the sun is.
