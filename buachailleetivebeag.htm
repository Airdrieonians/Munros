Buachaille Etive Beag
Stob Dubh(#76) & Stob Coire Raineach(#77)

Date : Sunday 30-May-2021

Left Fife at 8:24am
Arrived Glen Coe Car park 10:46am. Time 2:22 Drive.
The big car park for these Munros was full.
I thought it might be full as it is May bank holiday.
Andy Phillips arrive much earlier than me and could not get
a parking space there either.
Andy parked in the next small car park futher up the slope.
I was forced to go to the one further than that.
We had brought our bikes incase we need to cycle and mile 
or so to the starting point but 400 yards we can walk.

The hill is immediatly very steep, and doesn't get any better
 until three quarters the way to the bealach. 
Lots of folk on the hill today, many coming down passing us 
and we let some past us going faster then me.

Reached the 2452 feet (748m) Bealach in 2 hrs 09 mins.

We headed for the talest peak 1st. Sob Dubh.
Again very steep to the 1st top at 902m.

There was then not thw easy flatish ridge walk I expected but
 a long up an down ridge walk, a half mile to go.

We can see a snow splatered hunky hill to the North and 
wondered of it was in the Mamores group. Andy thought Nevis.
I thought that it looked too close for Nevis,but after I thought 
about it, maybe it was Nevis, 
I thought Nevis was 20 or 30 miles away, but I checked and it was
 only 9 miles away, we had a great view of it and Carn Mor Dear 
and the Arete too.

I struggle on slowly to the summit of Stob Dubh, Time 3:52.

Andy spots in the far SW twin peaks in the misty far off.
Latter I found out these were the Paps of Jura 75 miles distant.

We have great views of the Big Bauchaille of course and behind that Creise.

Decended bach to bealach in 50 mins. 4:48

I was defo going to try the Stob Corie Raineach,
I was tired but if I went slow I thought I could make it.

It was about half the distance of the Stob Dubh and not quite so high.
In my original Munros book this was not a Munro.

I struggled up in 50 mins. 5:38

Raced down as fast as I could in 1:27. Got back to car after 7:05 on the hill.
