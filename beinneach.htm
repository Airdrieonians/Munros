Beinn Each (Loch Lubnaig) (#2) 135th tallest Corrbett
[Horse hill]

Date : Sat 16-AUG-2025

Left Fife at 09:25am

Arrived Car Park est side of A84, 6 miles noth of Callander 11:50.
(comfort Stops at Stirling Services and Callander main car park)

22 DegC. intermittent sun. Cloud cover.

This is a nostalgic hill walk, 22 years ago I had my worst day in the hills, 
climbing to Stur a'Chroin over Beinn Each.
Exhaustion and hunger.

I wasn't sure if I had made the summit of Beinn Each back , then or 
I skirted round it on the way to 

1st section is through dense pine trees.
Which made it a bit cooler through the shade.

Fell runner guy, sounded English was running down and had a quick chat, 
he said the clouds ensured no view from the top, but will lift later.

A 30ish couple with a dog ,soon passed me with minimal back packs on the fallen tree section.

I reach a cross roads of paths in 30 Mins.

Then the path met a tractor track for the forestry commision, I turn left on to it.

A goup of 10 or so, 20 year olds passed all chatting and having fun.

I reach a large , head height size gate.

I'm out the forest now.

I soon see the wooden sigh post to start across the ferns towards the hill.

An uncomfortable 30 year old woman was standing there with bonoculars 
and her coat was hung on the sign.

I never spoke to her, she looked weird.

1st section was faily easy until the massive boulder, where it turned left and 
up the side of the burn, it got very steep.

3 late teen girls soon came up behing me and passed quickly, 
as an older man sat on a good resting rock.

He had lots to say.

I thought he was waiting for the girls as some sort of walk leader.
I thought the woman at the sign was too.

He said he had done all the hills and had 2 new hips, one was 
restricting his movement and he couldn't cycle or kayak anymore.
He had a great pic of himself with a natural rainbow round him up 
a hill and he had it printed and mounted on his wall at home.
He was complining about the midges further up, but it turn out,they were clegs not midges.
I told him about my 22 year old story doing Stur a'Chroin by this route,
He said a few folk he met today were ding just that, but he said the Loch Earn 
starting point was a much easier way to do the Stur.

A guy with a big dog was next to come down past me.

The path takes a left turn and becomes less steep for a section travelling in 
the loch earn direction. I make better progress until it turn directly up the 
hill for the next section, v steep again.

I reach the top of the steep climb and the gradient eases off.
I soon see the 3 girls coming down.

I ask how far to the top and they say a bit to go yet and the place is full of bugs.
I think she ment clegs, but they were not biting.

I heard their chat to each other, one was saying she was was thin and her sister was fat and her sister was envious of her for this, her sister eats 5 choc bars at a time , when she is unhappy and she had said she shouldn't do that.

I can see Loch Earn and Loch Lubnaig at the same time.

I reach summit in a disapintingly slow 3 hours 21 mins. I was aiming for 3 hours max.

I takes lots of detailed photos of the route to the Stur, the fatefull route of 22years past.
I have my super SLR camera with me for the purpose.

I must have reach the summit here 22 years ago, as there is no way to avoid it.

I look at the horizon and all the peaks arround, if they were Munros, I've climbed them all.

Fast pace coming down wuth no stops, met no one.
Decent 1 hour 34 mins.

15 mins on top

5 hours 10 mins on the hill.
