CacCarnBeag (Lochnagar) (#67)

Fri 19-JUL-2019

Left Fife at 09:25, with Florian Kuzel

Got to Glen Muick car park at 12:00 Set off at 12:09.
Did not have 4gbp to buy parking ticket so we got parking for free.

Walked North along a well maintained path. Up behind an old disused biulding and through a short forrest then had a wee break for food.

Left the forrest and on to a tractor track which slowly asends to the end of Alt na giubhsaich.

The track continues but there is a cairn to signify the route left down a small cleft the up to a rocky path snaking high towards the visible cliffs of Cac Carn Mor and Beag.

We then reached a bealach and the view of the cliffs and the LochNaGar at the foot of the cliffs.
The next incline to climb is very steep. I can see the Miekle Pap which is 3,213ft (980M).
I get exhaused towards the top and need to lie down to stop myself being sick.

After a beak of 20 mins I struggle on to the ridge. There is cloud comming over the top now.
We follow the ridge round the cliff untill we reach the great cairn of Cac Carn Mor. Florian asks if this is the the top. No its not. We move on another 0.5 Km towards the true top and see and older couple on the track in front of us. The wife is taking a picture to our left, which seems stuped since there is cloud all arround.  We ove closer and see 2 stags witj full antlers. Great pics. 

Its then a shot walk to the summit of Cac Carn Beag 4:10Hrs
