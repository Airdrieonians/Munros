Sgairneach Mhor

Sat 22-MAY-2010


Started @ Layby 81 on A9 at bottom of Allt Coire Dhomhain @ 12:33AM. 2Hrs drive from Airdrie.
Super Sunny 25  Degrees

We have to cross the Perth - Inverness rail line.
Hardly any trains go past, less than one an hour , I guess.

Book says go south 200 yrs to find brisge under railway.
Saw bridge too small to go under- we went over rails. 
It was the wrong one. it was further south.


Me & Keith walked up the tractor track.

After about 30 mins we need to cross Allt Coire Dhomhain.
A couple passed us going same way so we followed them where they crossed.
Did not see any easy stepping stones. We went further upsteam.
Keith eventually took the plung and stepped accross.
He got one foot wet.
I tried next. took deep breath to calm myself and balance then stepped quickly over with no wet feet!!

Steep heater hillside was in front of us.
We looked for a path, saw one higher up.
We tried to head for it. Avoiding heather feild and keeping to grass as much as possible, as its easyier walking.
A guy was comming down now on the path we saw.
He headed straight for Burn and crossed alittle downstream from a vertial line of 6 white stones on 
the opposite hillside.

It was slow progress for me. I was tyring easily.
Keith was full of energy and had to wait for me.
I took a proper lie down at 2hrs in and 30mins later.
This let my stomoch cramps subside and my pulse to get back to 80bpm.

A quick guy passed me lying there. Never saw him again til the car park at the end.

I was looking at the hills and top arround and checked on the map their hight.
I knew I was above 800m. There was not thet longer to go, 200m maybe.

I was on the ridge proper now and the path was well defined and easier walking.

I could see the top of A'Mharconcaich which is only 20meter lower than this one.
So We must be very close to the top.

Meet a number of groups comming down.
Soon we saw the snow close up on the Coire Creag.

A few hundred meters later was the summit 2hrs 45 mins.

Great views of all surrounding hills esp Beinn Udlamain.

Headed down ridge path and went further than we ment to and ended up on the slops of the 758m top.

Decided we have go too far. The further downstreeam we cross the burn the harder it will be not to get wet.

We head straight for the Burn thro' the heather, get there in 10-15 mins.
I choose great place to cross the burn, unscathed by water again.
Good waterfall - took good pics.

Simple walk back to car park from tractor track under railway at correct place this time.

Whe We got back to the road, I was knacked.
Had a lie down for 15 mins and had some food @ layby 79. before walking to my car a few hundred yrds north in layby 81.


Back at car @ 5:15PM after 4hrs 45mins on the hill.
A hard day @ office.
I was exhausted and need food to get me back fit to drive.
I stopped off at House of Bruar, but shut @ 5pm.
Had more food in car park before continuing to Airdrie.
Blackpool won play to ~English Premiership v Cardiff - shocker
Mrs G gave good dinner, chop tatties broccilli, ice cream. Set me up for drive to edinburgh to see Lesley.
Mr G was watching Inter play Bayrn in Euro cup final.
