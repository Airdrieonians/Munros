<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Meall Chuaich</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mon 06May19</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lesley and I drove from Duloch to Dalwhinnie arriving 1:30PM Left 11:35,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">far too late!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First time I have climbed a hill starting from our new home in Duloch, Fife.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bad start when I closed the car door on the plastic catch on my waste band of my ruck sack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It boke in two and I was force to tie it round my waiste instead. hat a pain.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'll need to buy a new Rucksack too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I brought my bike to help with the long 3 mile leadin path to the hill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I forgot my chain for security so I took the front wheel off and planked</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it part way up the hill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is the most northerly and last of the group of seven arround the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Drumocchter Pass, East of the mighty Loch Etrich.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As we parked at layby 94 on the southbound carriageway of the A9,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a walker was ariving back from Meall Chuaich cycling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was a fit looking 60 something year old. He told us about the weather</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and how his day went.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We took the bike and walked 50 yrds north to the field gate at the start</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the 3 mile track which leads to the electic power builing used to maintain</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the aquaduct which moved water from Loch Chuaich to Loch Etrich.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It a good quality path used by cars. Good for bike and walking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seemed to be downhill surprising ly. On the way back it seemed downhill too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I hid my bike minus front wheel at bottom of hill on right by some heather.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Th front wheel I plabked 100 yrds up the hill on the left by a big rock.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was  white wooden sihgn with "Walker Path" painted on it</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The climbing was steep from the start. Lesley much faster then me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was sunny at times wih little wind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After a short time it was possible to see the A9 and Loch Erich beyond, even Ben Alder caped with snow.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was some snow on the summit of Meall Chuaich too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We saw big rabbits or Hares now and again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is part of a grouse moor, so screaming panicy bird flew off now and again giving us  freit</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We were getting close to the sholder of the ridge when Lesley ask how long to the top we could see.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I said 25 mins, it took about another hour to get there. There were 3 or 4 false tops on the way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">there were light snow showers on our way up, as we neared the top we could see some big black</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">showers on the way, they passes staright doen th A9 glena dn mised us thankfully.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Near the top we spotted a climber comming down far on our left.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That was the onky climber we were to see on the hill all day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lesley was ahead and saw the final summit cairn before I did. She did a star jump and pointed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A few minutes later I saw the cairn for myself with some relief.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We took pics of Lesley hugging the large round cairn, also on with me star jumping on its wide</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">circular top.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Munro 65 for me and 3 for Lesley.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Well done both!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I had taken 3:45 Hrs to get here. The book said 2:40, so we were slow.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We were 1:30 at the base of the climb where I stowed my bike.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It would be 6:33Hrs by the time we got back to the car.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I  thought we would get back in half the time but the 3 mile lead in would be little faster going back.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the final stage when</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I found and picked up my bike wheel, I was skipping down the slope whith nthe wheel in my hand and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stepped on a collecion of smaller rocks and fell to my left. I felt myself falling and collapsed and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">relaxed my left leg. I jarred badly on impact. Lesley was on hnd to console me as I cryed out in pain.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a few minujtes later and I was gingerly on my feet again., but sore.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I p;ut the bike back together ahd head to the track.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I noticed I had only one cycle glove.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lesley suggested going back for it, must have nbeen when I fell.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have not stregth to go back. I'll just by a new pair.</span></p>
