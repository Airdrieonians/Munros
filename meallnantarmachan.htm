<br>
I took me 1hour 45 minutes to reach the Ben Lawers visitors Centre. <br>
The car park was open but the building, including the toilet were closed.<br>
 A sign said they open on May 1st, that was 6 days time. This highlights how early in the year<br> 
this is and this will be my first Munro in the month of April.
<br>
There were loads of strange insects fly arround and I think they were searching for heat. 
<br>They sat contentedly on the bodywork of the car and on the seast covers.
<br>They looked a bit like clegs but looked more frendly.
<br>
<br>
It said in the guide book that you can park next to a locked gate half a mile on from the center 
<br>and that this is the closest to the hill. I drove on and there is a wee
<br>dirt track car park full with 15 or so cars. There was a bridge over a burn and there were 
<br>some cars parked over the other side. I drove over and thought I could squeze in somewhere. 
<br>There was an easy space luckily enough.
<br>
<br>
I started over the gate and followed the dirt track for 5 minutes then a visable path veered off
<br> to the right. It was easy enough walking and the sun was out from the broken cloud.
<br>
<br>
I wore my baseball cap to guard against sunstoke after my painfull experience on Brariach. 
<br>I climbed for 10 minutes and was feeling like a rest and I lay down facing Ben Lawers in the
<br> direction I had come. There was a group of folk starting to walk up from the car park I 
<br>reckoned I had 15 minutes start and wondered if I could out pace them.
<br>
<br>I was not feeling too stronge or energettic so I doubted if I could hold them off for long.
<br>
<br>
Just as I was setting off again they caught me and we crossed each other for ten minutes.
<br> I was wearing my Airdrie strip and the guys in the group which included 2 women asked me 
<br>if we had won promotion yet. I said we need one more point
<br>
<br>
As I got higher Stob Benien and Ben more came into view. They looked great with a good snow 
<br>cover especially on stob benien. I could work out looking south which peaks were 
<br>Ben Vorlich and Stur Chorin(I had big problem climbing that also). I had climbed all these 
<br>and it felt good knowing that. I off course had the best view of Ben Lawers and its 3 
<br>closest neighbours all of them I have climbed. Just through a gap to the north of 
<br>Ben Lawers I could see a really sharp peak. I looked on the map to identify it and found 
<br>it was not a munro. There are 2 munros over that side but this was a top which sit in
<br> between.
<br>
<br>
I was high enough to be on the main ridge now and I was struggling along slowly. 
<br>The group od 20 somethings had long gone now. There was a false top (as there often is) on
<br>this munro. I reched there and rested. I could not see the group that had passed me, they
<br> must have motored up the steep hillside. But then they came ito view they were in a dip in
<br> the landscape. The progresses slowly up the steep incline. I then gave away a fair bit of
<br> hieght before climbing again as they had done. I knw it was less than 100 meters in hieght
<br> to go according to the map.
<br>
<br>
The incline was steep and a a point near the top I lay downa nad rested for a good while waiting
<br> for my heat to het down from 110 bpm.
<br>
<br>
There was some snow arround but not on the path so there was no problem. I came round the final 
<br>bend to see the group ahead sitting at the summit.
<br>
<br>
I chatted to them and They took my pic and I took theres. They sounded like students or recent
<br> graduates. They were up this hill last week when the cloud was so low and the rain so 
<br>horizontal that they thought the false top was the summit and walked back down.
<br>
<br>
One guy was on the mobile taking to his pal who was here last week and told him he had failed
<br> to bag this munro.
<br>
<br>
Another of the guys was a Dundee Utd supporter interested in Owen Coyle etc.
<br>
<br>
They were doing the whole ridge walk but I was too tired already and I soon started down again.
<br>
<br>
I met an old guy (60 maybe) and a young gorgeous girl (18 maybe.)
<br>
<br>
We chatted for a bit, she was great and made me smile. The guy was really enthusiastic about 
<br>the weather and the hill etc.
<br>Good on him, hope I am still at it in 25 years time.
<br>
<br>
On the drive back I stopped at Stirling services which is becoming a bit of a tradition with me. 
<br>After the customary baked beans and baked potato I continued home alert and feeling good.
