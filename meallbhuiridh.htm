Left mine at 8:30, Andy Driving.

Stopped off at Weely boot chop in Tyndrum for sanies

Got to GlenCoe 11:00.

Parked at Glencoe Ski center


Walk straight up the line of SKI Pylons.

I could see eight but there were nine to the top of the first steep slope.
Then there was a bit of a plateau. 1Hr 5 Mins

We walk straight up the 2nd set of Ski lifts too.
Could see the Big Buchille and the Creise which we hopped to do today too.

Sun peeped through the clouds every now and then.

Go to summit 2Hrs 26 Mins
South Wind really hit us then, cloud came down quickly too.

We headed for the Bealach 600 feet down hill towards Creise.
Cloud was still with us so we waited for it to clear.
Wind should push us up the ridge to Creise

The wind got worse the cloud got worse, so we headed back 
heading part way up the corie, to get out of the v.stong wing.
Walking on scree/shail. bit scary under foot v.steep.
Took us 50 mins to get back to our upward path.
Andys GPS helped us find the path.
Now stared raining too.
Headed down as fast as we could in deteriating weather.
Back to car 5 hrs on Hill.

Back home by 8pm.

My first Munro for 15 months..!!
