Beinn A'Chlachair (Loch Laggan) (#91)(M-053)
[Hill of the Stonemason]

Date : Wed 02-OCT-2024

Left Fife at 08:30am

Arrived Car Park east of bridge over river spean west of Loch Laggan car park 11:04:.
(comfort Stops at Azda Perth, House of Bruar and Wolktrax loch laggan)

15 DegC. It will be 8Deg at the summit

Used bike to get to beach of Lochan An h-Earba(Small loch of the roe deer).

I meet a young guy on the way.
I ask which hills he is going to do today.
He says he is doing the East Highland Way.
I've never heard of that.
He sounds foreign.

Took photos of beach.
I hide bike on tractor track to start of climb. 0:53mins.
I saw 2 other bike by the burn.

I reached the crossing of the Alt Pitridh burn in 1:21.

At 1:50 I reach the cutting of the Burn where there is a rock cairn to say 
this is the place to leave the path to head directly for the summit. 
I could have gone to the Bealach Leamhain ans scalled the near cliff like rock 
shoulder but I was scared of the hand hold climbing or scree that might be there.

So I head accross the muir, whioch was not boggy as i have feared.
It was only 300 yds to get to the start of the clmb proper.
I was very slow at this point, but steady progress.
Long hard slog up the face of the ridge. No fun.
I was getting v tired.
The path runs out part way up, so I start a long zig zag to try to reduce 
the gradient.
I can see the boulder fieds on the crest of the ridge now.
I pick my way forward on the grass between the boulder fields.
5 great looking birds with white wing ends and white underparts fly away 
from me in fear.

I love the view over the Munros Creag Pitridh & Geal Charn, both of which 
I have done aleady.
I look down on them as this is the tallest of the 3.

I see a confusing sight of a lower ridge on my left.
I start to realise to my pleasure , this is the ridge leading from the Bealach.
I'm not far off the summit now. half a mile .

I work my way higher over the boulders finding the shortest route.

Reach Simmit at 4:43 on hill.

My trust cannon compact camera died trecently.
So i'm trying to use my phone.
The power keeps dying.
I get one pic on top before it dies too.

The views are the greatest. 
Ben Alder, the thin slab of Bein Bheoil, Anoch Beag and the Drumochter hill 
which are far off.
There are other Munros looking north over the opposite side of Loch Laggan.

I do not linger on top.
Wind is picking up.

I head for the bealach.
I want to see how bad the shoulder of the ridge would have been to climb up.

There are places where you need to use hand holds, but no scree.

Reach staukers path at 6:02 on the hill.
Back at bike 7:10.
Back at car 7:30 on hill. starting to get dark.
 
This might be my last Munro.
They are getting too hard and traveling time is getting to long to get 
there and back in a day.
Corbetts are much more convienient.
