An Socach(GlenShee)

Fri 16-APR-2010


Started @ A93 @ 11:00AM. 2Hrs 10 mins drive from edinburgh
Sunny - 12 Degrees
Cylced up tractor trck for 1.5 miles.
That was tiering. Took me 25 mins

I locked bike and started wlking up the hill.
Hard going as I was knackered from the bike ride.

Patchy snow everywhere.
Got high enough to see snowy hills in NorthWeest.

Saw 2 folk coming down seperatly as I was going up the last steep climb.
Got rocky at the north-top @ 1:45PM.

Great views and it got a bit windy.

I then had to walk nearly a mile along the ridge to the Munro summit 
which is only 6 m higher than the north-top.

Met 2 old folk from down south. must have been 60+.
One from Wales and one from norhampton.
They were on a week long walking holiday.
Had done 3 Munroes already when I met them.
They pointed out which direction the Lairg Ghru was.

Walked down to the col and dropped to Glen floor.(took 45 mins)
Walked along tracter track to my bike (took another 35mins)
Got bike and cycled back to car(15 mins)

Back at car after 6hrs on the hill.
