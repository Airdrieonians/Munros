Beinn Na Lap (Loch Ossian) (#87)(M-241)
{Dappeled hill}

Date : Tue 05-Sep-2023

Left Fife at 07:58am

Arrived Car Park Rannoch Station car park 10:28:  2:30 Drive.(comfort Stops at Azda Pertha and House of Bruar)

23 DegC. beautiful sunny day.  It will be high teens Deg at the summit

The train was due 11:09, It came 11:45.
Station has good toilet and tea room.
about 15 folk waiting for the trian, all elderly. 

Arrive Corrour just before Noon.
I stash extra bottle of water at tree near Corrour station hotel.
Turns out the outside tap is available at hotel front and at Loch OLssian Youth Hostel.

22 mins on a very good track to juction, turn left then 5 mins more to leave the track and head on the grssy hill.

The path is straight up the side of the hill and easy to see.

Surprisingly no one on the train is doing Beinn Na Lap today.

Many have bikes.
I spoke to a young woman and her young child stapped to the child seat at front.

Slow going, a bit boggy in places.

I get passed by 3 folk on the way down, a 30 something guy, almost running and a eastern European sounding couple.

Great view of Loch Ossian and all the hills arround, Shehallion very easy to spot as I get higher.
I see a great gruoptop the north West, Which I later identify as the grey corries.

I reach the top of the climb when it becomes a less steep ridge walk.

After a few false tops which I was not taken in by,
I reach summit 3:06. 

Corrour station is 1338 ft, so 1730 feet took 2:36 from leaving the road.
That is only 665 ft per hour.
20 mins on top, for lie down and photos.
Got my poles out for decent.
Near the bottom when I thoght I was going to be last on the hill today a 20 something girl passes me going up.
She has been camping and- doing the hills from one glen tro the next , she said
the 2 other corrour hills are a hard slog with no path. She did them today.

she will camp at top of Na Lap tonight.

1 hr decent to the road track. Good gloing.

4:30 on the hill.

I head for the Youth hostal on the banks of Loch Ossian,
One of the best locations I have ever seen in Scotland.
Great loch view and a pass and steap hills in the distant skyline.

I walk the 25 mins back along the track to the station and grab a beer and sit 
outside with walkers and cylists. Train came at 6:25 on time.
Got car at 6:45 home by 8:45, via Killiecrakie with no stops.
