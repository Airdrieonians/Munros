Glas Maol, Cairn of Claise, Carn an Tuirc

Sat 07-JUN-2008

Started walk at Glenshee Ski centre @ Noon with Andy Phillips
took 2:10 hrs to drive there from Edinburgh.
Sunny 20 Degrees

Crossed road and followed Ski toe up Meall Odhar Then Path up 
to Glas Maol. Easy going 2hrs to top.

Met woman at top with 2 dogs. She had started further south 
in Glenshee and climbed Creag Leacach first. 
Looking back at where she had come, that Munro looked really 
impressive. We will need to do that sometime, but not today.

We are no on the top a a plateau and can see over to Cairnwell 
etc to the west and the hills beyond and to the norht west 
where there was a still a fair bit of snow on the summits we 
could see. Those might be Caringorm.

We rekoned it would take an hour to get to the next top which
we could see clearly, Cairn of Claise.
It was fairly flat. 
We came accross some snow fields and could see bigger ones on 
the north facing slopes.
We got a great view of the CaenLochan Glen, with its massive 
steep cliff sides.

Reached Cairn of Claise after 3:10 Hrs, view is better hear 
on this clear sunny day. Looked for the other 2 Munros here 
abouts Tolmount & Tom Buidhe but could not work out where they 
were, I was looking East instead of North East.
Woman with 2 kids were on top with us 
and a couole with one kid arrived soon. I asked the woman about
 doing the Carn an Tuirc, how easy it was and if there was any 
difficulty in decending from there. She said it was fine.
We considered it thats was were we wanted to go next. I talked 
Andy into doing it. It was a breeze, got there in 30 mins, saw 
some big Hares on the way.

Decended Carn an Tuirc on the West side.
We were startled by a Ptarmigan on the way down.
There were 3 chicks scapering in all directions to get away from us.
The chickes were tumbling then running then tumbling again. 
The Mother was doing some agressive scampering in front of us.
Later we startled a Black Grouse. So we saw plenty of wildlife.

It is quite a steep decent but we reach the Glen floor and follow 
the burn to the main road. crossed what looks and ancient bridge.
walked adjacent to the road following the burn till the land rose
to meet the road and floowed the road up to the Ski Centre where 
we started. 
6:15Hrs in all.
