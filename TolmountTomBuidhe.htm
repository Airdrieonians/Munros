Toulmont and Tom Buidhe

Sun 12-JUN-2011

Left mine at 8:30, Andy Driving.

Stopped off at Sainsbury's in Kinross for sanies.

Got to Glenshee 10:30.

Cloudy, 15 degrees.

Parked at Glenshee usual place.

Skirted north over shoulder od Glas Moel, hopefully for the last time.
Ther was a snow ridge still there from the winter.

We walked down on to the plateau.

Rested at stone windbreak on the top of a small rise which lay 
between 2 streams leading in to the deep corrie. 

Walked on towards Carn a Claise, turned East round the shoulder to avoid 
unnecessary climbing.
Andy had GPS to help.
We can now see Tom Buidhe clearly.
We discussed if we should climb Tolmount or the Tom B first.

We were at the Summit of Tom B in 3 hrs 5 mins. Stayed 10 mins on top.
2 guys from Kircaldy wee on top had quick cat to them.

off to Tolmount down the glen that seperates them, and up the other side.
No path here.

Reached summit Tolmount 4Hrs 5 mins.
A fell runner and dog passed us by on the top while we were there.

We can see Loch Callater to the north.

Back West again, on the long trek back to Glas Moel.

Bit sogy underfoot and it started to rain slightly.

Saw Ptarmagin bird, lots of hares.
We startiled a hairy rabbit thing, wich did not run far.
Andy took pics of it. looked like a big hair hamster.

we continued on for 1 hrs 10 mins to reach the wind break again.

We reated 20mins then 25 mins to top of chairlift at Glas Moel.

We looked back at Glas moel and saw a mad B/stard trying to walk 
down the near sheer corrie face of Glas Moel.

Back at car after 7Hrs 10mins on the hill.
Back home by 8pm.
