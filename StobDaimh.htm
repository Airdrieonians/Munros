Stob Daimh [in Ben Cruachan group]

Sat 28-Jul-2007

Started walk near Dalmally @ 12:30PM with Jim Wilson
took 2.5 hrs to get there - a bit tooo long I am thinking.

Started in sunshine, but threatened showers.
Easy walk up tractor track to cross burn before incline started.
Tough assent, pretty steep.
I was struggling a bit.
a few short showers on the way.
After 3 hrs walking, I wondered If I should pack it in.
I was feeling tired.
I soildered on for a little more when we thought we saw the top.
Struggled to the a top which was after the false summit.
I thoght I had made it.
It started to rain.
I put waterproffs on again.
Folk walked past and told us we were not on Stob Daimh yet it was 
the next summit along the horseshoe shaped ridge.
They had come from Ben Cuchan which they had done earlier.

After a short rest I felt a bit better and we went to the proper top.
took about 4hrs 15 mins.
It was raining so we did not hange around long
We sheltered under a big bouldr below the summit with some Germans
and other passed by. A good few folk up the hill today.
2 guys passed with drenched and unhappy girlfriend in tow.
We had a we chuckle at that.

The wind blew the cloud away again and it was sunny.
I felt better and we walked round the rest of the horseshoe
close to where we stareded.
It was difficlt to come of the last ridge to the glen floor,
very steep and no obvious path.

Got back the the bridge over the burn and stoped for tea and chocolate.

I was relieved I had made it.

Stopped at Crainlarich, for food, I was starving 
could not had driven home without food.
