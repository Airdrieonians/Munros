I had passes Ben Lomand a few times when walking the West Highland Way.

My younger sister April was talking about climbing it with her boyfriend at the time, Jack.
Note: Me and April had climbed the Cobbler(Ben Arthur) previously. That was not a Munro though.

I said I would come along too.

It was a dead nice day and I remember it being fairly hard. At the top I said it was not that bad after all and April
said I have a cheek saying that since I was moaning all the up.
