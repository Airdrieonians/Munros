Geal Charn (Loch Laggan) (#88)(M-81)
[White Hill]

Date : Sat 31-Aug-2024

Left Fife at 08:43am

Arrived Car Park west of bridge over river spean west of Loch Laggan car park 11:10: 
2:27 Drive.(comfort Stops at Azda Perth, House of Bruar and Wolktrax loch laggan)
I couldn't get in the car park east of the bridge , full up.
18 DegC. Full sun. It will be 10Deg at the summit

Used bike all the way to the foot of the climb after beach at the west end of Lochan Na H-Earba. 
Push ing it uphill a few times only. got to foot of climb 58 mins , 17 mins faster than last time.

Hid bike by others. One was at the end of the tractor track, 2 more closer to climb start.

Fell runner with bright yellow rimmed sungalsses passes me very early, jogging fast.
I would see him again on the path closest to Gean Charn.
He was going off peist. 

I see a guy far off, comming down Craig Pitrdh, on a far off path.

28 mins into the climb I reach a dip and a  ford of the Allt Choire Pitridh.
3 mins slower than last time, for this section.

This is a good path that takes me very near the bealach between 
Beinn a' Chlachair and Geal Charn.

I reach it after 2:43, 5 mins slower than last time.

I see a couple come down a random route from Geal Charn.
I ask if they used a path but they were freestyling.
They climbed Geal Charn form the South, I saw them head for the Bealach and then decend past 
the Loch a'Bhealaich Leamhain at 3K feet.

I'm not going all the way the book suggests. 
I will go as far as the SE path starts to decend and 
head straight for the summit accross boulders and heather

I was vearing east to try to meet up with the path the book recomended. 
I see 2 women making good use of their ski poles passing me 100 yards to my right. 

I make good progress and see a summit ahead.
It didn't look like the real summit.

On reaching it I see a summit cone a good way ahead of me.
I'm not happy, I will need to decend abit to climb the cone summit.
I see the womean are already there.

I catch the southerly wind full blast now.
It is only an anoyance. But I don't linger at the top.

Reach Summit 4:03.

My compact camera isn't working so only my phone to take pics.
The woman have bagged the side of the summit cone shaded from the wind.

I can see the Drumochter hills, I've done them all.
One has the same name as this one.
I think that must mean different clans must have been in charge on either side of Ericht Loch.
They wouldn't name two hills the same in their domain.

I decend trying to return the way I came.

but I ended up taking the path the book had suggested for the acent.
It was a bog-fest. I'm glad I never acesnded this way.

40mins to get back to path.

I'm interested in seeing how hard the rocky sholder of Beinn a' Chlachair 
would be to climb if I come back again to complete the 3rd Munros in this group.

I head for the bealach.
I see the Lochan at 3K, it looks great.

Sholder is very steep and I would have to be reasonaly fresh o do it.

Decent to car takes 1:20.

I meet a fat guy coming up with full pack on his back.
He is camping at the bealach tonight and will do the 2 easterly Munros 
before dark and do the other tomorrow.

I stop at the beach and meditate a bit.
Great place, would love to take Lesley here.
There is a tent on the south edge of the beach and a couple the north side of the bridge.

I cycle back on the track and a meadow pipit or some such flys with me in front of my bike.
It is racing me. I start to get v close and I'm afread I will run it over.

It flies of to the left. 
Great experiance.

6:47 on the hill.
