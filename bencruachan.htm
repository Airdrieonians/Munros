Ben Cruachan

Sat 17-May-2008

Started walk at Cruachan Train Station @ 11:45PM with Andy Phillips
took 2.5 hrs to drive there from Edinburgh.
Cloudy 15 degrees - good weather.

Difficult to find place to cross train line to start up the hill.
Walked west along road 50 yards and up a layby to cross the railway 
and start up a steep lightly wooded hillside following the west bank 
of a burn. (Should have crossed railway at station going under bridge)

After 40mins reached a style over a 6 ft fence.
Turned left up a grassy slope following the fence.
Impressive front of Cruachan Resovioir Dam came into view

Stopped for rest and butties on hill side, saw young deer patrolling 
fence as if trying to get accross it.

Continued North and crossed the service road for the Dam.
This is the start of the hill proper to Meall Cuanail top.
Can see most of Loch Awe behind us.
Greate view of the houreshoe corrie, can see Stob Daimh where I 
was last year.

Cloud began to break and can see Ben Mor on Mull and the mouth
of Loch Etive. With the bridge over to Bon Awe from Taynauilt.

Saw two Ptarmagine, took pics of them and the wandered off.
3Hrs 10 Mins in books starting to look every optimistic.
Finally reach the Meall Cuanail south top.
3hrs 40Mins.

Can see two walkers comming down from Cruachan to the col.
These are first folk we have seen all day, except dots on the 
far ridges we saw move.
Andy spoke to them at the col, one was stuggling and going 
slowly, the dropped down to the Resovoir road from the col.

It was 4 hrs gone at the col.

We could now see the top of Cruchan, the earlier cloud was 
gone from the summit.
The traverse was very steep and near the top very rocky.
Scrabling over boulders. Saw two other folk passing us 
comming down.

Reached top after 5 hrs.
Great view to the west, cloudy to the east.

Took 35mins back down to the col.
Pass two folk going up - bit late me thinks.

Dropped down to the Resivoir road 1 hr from top.
Walked down the road to the Dam,
Crossed the Dam bridge and cut back to the start of the 
path down to the style again after rest and butties.

Got back to Car 8 hr 15 mins after we left it.
