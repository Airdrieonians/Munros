Beinn An Dothaidh

Sun 08-Jul-2007

Started walk at Bidge of Orchy Train Station car park @ noon

Bit cloudy and threatening showers with Keith Gibb
Bit boggy in places.
Drag up to col.
Choice of Dorain on right or Dothaidh on left(lowest)
Tried easy one first, met some old folk who were comming down.
Told us it was cloudy on top.
It had started to drizzle already.

Got to top quickly from col.
Too cloudy to know were top was exactly.
The wind blew a hole in the cloud luckelly so we could see.
We were on the wrong top and qickly moved to correct summit point.
cloud came in again, got lost a bit getting back to the col.
Dorain was in complete cloud did not bother with it just came 
down again

Met some of the old folk at the car park.
They said it is always very boggy.

Stopped at the Tyndrum Welly boot shop and eat some food.
Got back to Keiths house in Airdrie were I was seved dinner.
Nice!
