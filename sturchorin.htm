I parked at a layby on the Callender road. There is a footpath from Loch Lubnaig to Loch Earn throu the Glen Ample. on the east side of the glen is the Stur a'Chroin and Ben Vorlich. 
<br>
<br>
I had done Ben Vorlich before from the Locj Earn Side so I did not want to do it agin. 
<br>
<br>
I chose a different route for Stur A'Chroin, past Bein Each. That was as expected but when I got near the top of Bein Each I hav hoped it was a ridge alk the 2 miles to Stur A'Croin. But to my shock it was an array of cliffs. I was very tired when I got up the Each but I consoled myself that I have climbed most of the height I needed and there was only a small climd required for Stur A'Chroin after a flat ridge walk.
<br>
<br>
On the other side of the Each I met a tall thin guy comming he other way. Hw had 2 ski polls to help him climb. He said he had come from Loch Earn and had climbed Ben Vorlich and Stur A'Chroin already today.
The massive clifs ahead of me could be walked round with a vague path so I would not have to climb them.
<br>
<br>
I huffed and puffed andf with many rests I finally made it to the simmit. But I felt cheated that I had to give away a lot of the hieght I had gain on the Each before reaching the Stur.
<br>
<br>
I had ran out of food by now and was planning to head straight down the stur ro the Glen floor avaiding rocks and cliffs. This seemed easy enough by following a fair sizes burn (Allt0 marked on the map. This came to a forrest close to the Glen flor and I had to climb a 6'' fence to get in to the forrest and I had to fight thru the under grouth to get to the path. This completelt exhauseted me and with no food I tried to walk at a slow steady pace to got the 2-3 miles back to my car. but at least it was on a flat path not a grassy, rocky or forrested hill.
<br>
<br>
After 10 minutes my god given path diasspeared and I was walking amonst the trees again, getting more tired and antious with every step. I was sure this path ran the whole length of the Glen, so how could it just stop.
<br>
<br>
I came to a clearing in the trees and I could see down to the burn that runs trou the Glen there was what looked like a path down there but would that just stop the way the previous on had? I figured even if it did it would not be any worse than the treck I was doing throu these trees. 
<br>
<br>
So I decended throu the clearing doun to the base of the Glen and found the real path, this was the one that ran from Loch to Loch. I was starting to have stumach cramps now the exhaustion was getting worse. My body was telling me It had had enough, and I had not eaten for hours. I notice the socking wet T shirt I have sweated on all day and put through the straps of my ruchsack had gone. It must have been when I was sliding down the grass on  my bum trying to save energy on th decent. It was the gran Canaria on that had "You had to be there" written on the back. Linda had given me it from her holiday there many years ago, it was well the worse for wear - that was why I wore it.
<br>
<br>
The path got boggy in places, then I started to fell the faint spray of rain. Not only was I exhausted , starving and pissed off but now it was oing to rain. It did not get heavier than spay. Thank god for that.
<br>
<br>
I tied to keep up a steady pace, accelleration takes too much energy. I recognised the hill on the west side of the Glen in front of me. I stared at it from the Each for more than an hour, but it semed a long way off, bu that was safty if I got there.
<br>
<br>
I reach a fallen notice board with a map on it showing were I was. I use my thumb to measure how far to the car, about 2 miles I reckon. Christ thats another 40 minutes walking. Could I keep walking that long? I trudge on. I forgot my mpobile it i in the car, I toy with getting my waterprofs on but I will wait till I feel cold before doing that. After a while the hill on the west side seems closr and the rain stops. hen I look up and at Bein Each and a deep burn running down its side. I sudenly recognise it, it is the burn I started to climb by ob the way up the Each. Great, thank christ I know It is not far now. I sit where I sat before the accent on the same boulder. It was sunny and worm then. It is a lot colder and damp now. I rest but my somach crap is still there and the rest will not make that go. So I do not stay long and continue to the top of the forrest path only a few hundered metters to my carr - all downhill.
<br>
<br>
In the forest I met a young could on there mountain bikes they are going to ride up Glen Ample to loch Earn tonight, it is after 7 pm we agree. its getting late but the light will be there til 9pm at least.
His really nice girlfriend asks if I got caught in the rain. I said it was more drizzily than anything, but she said it was torential where they were, so I was lcky I did not get soaked. 
<br>
<br>
So I left Edinburgh at 11am got parked ar 12:30 and it is now 7:37pm. What a day- ran out of food got a bit lost, underestimated the dificlty of the route, got eained on and I am exhauseted and starving.
<br>
<br>
I drive but I am too tired really. I stop in at Doune at the sweet shop and by chocolate. I eat 3 bars and feel abit better. I drive on th Striling serves and get a baked potato and beans with hot tea, it tastes geeeeet! I feel good now and it is safe to drive the rest of the way home. I watch some teelly take a bath and go to bed. But I can not sleep. I feel abit hyper. I take my pulse - it is 84 at rest! I am clearly not in a good way. I eventially sleep at 2:20am and wake at 6:40. My pulse is still too high at 75. But I have survivbed to climb another day.......
